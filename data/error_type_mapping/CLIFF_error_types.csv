CLIFF,xsum,21267591,"Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer ""concrete solutions"". ""We want someone who can speak for the royal family,"" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. ""We welcome it, we are ready for it,"" he said. ""We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary."" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. ""A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people"". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. ""We had an agreement with the crown prince,"" he said. ""The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue."" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was ""hopeful"" that he would ""do more than his predecessor"", Hillary Clinton. ""US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more."" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. ""If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. ""It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. ""So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy."" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for ""peaceful demonstrations"", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. ""It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government."" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. ""These people have a lot of followers in the street.

It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date. Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. ""Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,"" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said.

This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago. As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved. The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16. Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many. ""There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence.

On Thursday, the New York Times described the policy as ""brutal"". In an editorial, the newspaper said the ""ruthlessly effective"" policy was ""inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war"". It said it would be ""unconscionable"" for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies, as Mr Abbott has previously suggested. Australia has not responded to the editorial, but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family, was ""very sad"".

CLIFF,xsum,37546354,"Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo.

CLIFF,xsum,19311364,"Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. ""Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. ""That seems fairer to me,"" he added. The think tank also said the move would be ""extremely popular"" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be ""cleansed"" of ""hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices"". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced ""radical reforms"" to ""get Britain building"" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme ""set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes"". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure ""social housing goes to those in greatest need"", he added.",Prime Minister David Cameron has said councils should be allowed to sell off social housing in the most expensive areas of the UK to raise money to build more affordable homes.,BART,test,correct,

It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. ""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. ""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.

CLIFF,xsum,26381454,"Pro-Kremlin party A Just Russia put forward both bills, and linked them directly to the situation in Ukraine. Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov.

CLIFF,xsum,36404868,"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

""We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,"" says Mr Parker. ""The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity."" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. ""Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,"" he says. ""The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. ""It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world."" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times.

Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. ""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. ""The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago."" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being ""too religious"". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. ""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal. ""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. ""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga."" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. ""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.

CLIFF,xsum,34743526,"Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"". Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. ""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made."" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low."" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"". He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.

CLIFF,xsum,40883148,"The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: ""I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves."" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. ""Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,"" said Bennett. ""To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine."" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: ""I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands."" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a ""litany of information"" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were ""several reasons to approve the fight"". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. ""I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,"" said Bennett. ""He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. ""Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. ""Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. ""That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight."" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: ""He's good to go."" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an ""out of control"" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.","Conor McGregor is set to be allowed to use 8oz gloves in his boxing debut against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on 26 August, the Nevada commission has confirmed.",BART,val,"['intrinsic-predicate', 'intrinsic-NP', 'extrinsic-NP']","['Conor McGregor is set to be allowed', 'Floyd Mayweather', 'Las Vegas', '26 August']"
CLIFF,xsum,36882573,"Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,"" he says. ""The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards."" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. ""Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. ""But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. ""When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. ""Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. ""The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. ""At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. ""I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. ""He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'"" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the ""Stab in the Back"" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline. ""As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,"" says Mr Smith. ""It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.""",Two of the last journalists to work in Fleet Street have spoken of their shock at the news that the street is set to close its doors for the last time.,BART,test,correct,

CLIFF,xsum,34802406,"It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""","Poorer young people are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system than their better - off counterparts, according to a new study.",BART,test,correct,

CLIFF,xsum,32715299,"It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and ""fingerprinting"" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named ""Dynamic Mongoose"", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a ""key vulnerability"". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be ""exceptionally worried"" that it is seen as a ""soft touch"", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review.

CLIFF,xsum,38328811,"United Nations officials rarely use the words ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing,"" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. ""They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,"" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. ""They don't want us,"" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. ""These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them."" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.""We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,"" he said. ""It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed."" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. ""This has been unrelenting since July,"" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. ""The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides."" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in.

The victim was taken to Northern General hospital but died from his injuries. Local residents said the man was a member of a family who live close to the scene of the shooting. They said relatives had been gathering for a family celebration when the attack occurred. Many came out of the house to try to help him after hearing the shot, neighbours said. There have been a number of shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks, although all the previous incidents have been in the north of the city and not close to the Upperthorpe area. On Monday, a 25-year-old man was seriously injured when he was shot in the street in the Shiregreen area. Earlier this month, an elderly couple were left shocked when shots were fired through their living room window in the Southey Green area - an incident police believe was a case of mistaken identity.

CLIFF,xsum,30453069,"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

CLIFF,xsum,35820385,"Presiding officer Tricia Marwick shed tears after veteran Labour MSP Duncan McNeil bid farewell to the parliament. And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber: ""It's goodbye from me... for now"". Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May. Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was ""not divided, but diverse"". He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: ""Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided. There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland. ""And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that"". He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign. There were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a ""major attraction down south today"". He then added: ""However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks."" And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, ""albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm"". He concluded his address by saying: ""Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament. ""There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country. ""And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now"". Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had ""served the parliament and Scotland with distinction"". The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999. Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system. He said: ""It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary. ""We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences."" He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster. But Mr McNeil said: ""It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business."" Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.

""I have travelled extensively across Wales, meeting with many older people living in residential care, and have seen for myself the positive impact that high quality care can have on people's lives. ""However, I have also received an increasing amount of correspondence in the past year about the quality of life and care of older people living in residential care and I have spoken publicly about what I consider to be unacceptable variations across Wales."" The commissioner will be reviewing whether older people living in residential care have a good quality of life by looking at factors such as physical and psychological health, social relationships and the care home environment. Her team will also speak to care providers, social care staff and public bodies. ""By giving a voice to older people and their families, my review and recommendations will ensure that those who are accountable for and run our services understand the day-to-day realities of living in residential care in Wales and the action required to deliver the change needed to ensure that that older people living in residential care have the best quality of life,"" she said.

Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts. The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of ""destabilising the market"". Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours.

Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime.

The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""

He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights. The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law. Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros. Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months. Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: ""No. Why should we? ""These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues."" The minister added that ""my Polish colleague"" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary. EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously. Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports. Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law. Hungary's Higher Education Law, signed in April, could force the closure of the Budapest-based CEU, which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines. Meanwhile, draft legislation on NGOs is expected to go before parliament soon. Human rights groups say it would stigmatise them as ""foreign-backed"" organisations.

CLIFF,xsum,33960105,"They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. ""There's a huge market for our timber.

The scale of the agency's global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden. The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance. The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine, and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions. German media say the man arrested this week is a 31-year-old employee of the federal service, the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst.

My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

CLIFF,xsum,14844413,"Now the complete ban is being lifted.  Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation. From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months. This deferral period has been left in place because there is a ""window period"" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable. This window period is far less than 12 months. The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days. In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner. By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men. Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long. Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. ""To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence."" But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: ""The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses."" A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute. NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate. The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.

CLIFF,cnndm,122337044e34f279f3bfac270816b52e4d323af1,"Ronald Koeman is looking forward to this weekend's 'special' match against Tottenham, ahead of which the Southampton manager praised the 'great job' predecessor Mauricio Pochettino did at St Mary's. The former Argentina defender ended a 16-month stint on the south coast last summer to sign a five-year deal at White Hart Lane. Pochettino's exit was the catalyst to an unparalleled talent drain from St Mary's, although successor Koeman has not only steered the club to calmer waters but to new heights. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has praised the work of his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino at the club.

Southampton full-back Nathaniel Clyne (left) tussles for possession with Stoke's Steven Nzonzi (right) Stoke forward Jonathan Walters dribbles ahead of Southampton's Maya Yoshida (right) in their last game. Koeman had to cope with several player sales at Southampton, including Luke Shaw to Manchester United . Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana (right) was also sold to Liverpool shortly after Koeman arrived at the club. With five matches remaining, Saints are just a point and a place worse off than Spurs in sixth and can usurp them in the European spots with victory in Saturday's early kick-off. 'Everybody was afraid because we had to make a lot of changes in the team,' Koeman told reporters. 'But I think the quality of the players that we brought in were good, at a good level. I think the rest of the players had really a good aspiration and ambition to do a good season, to play a good season at a good level. 'Now we are fighting for a high position in the table. There's still five games to play and a very nice one this Saturday afternoon. 'It is Tottenham, the difference is only one point and, okay, for the fans maybe it makes it a little bit more special because Mauricio is now the coach and was the coach of Southampton. 'He is the coach of the opponent this Saturday, so that makes it special but the game will be decided between the white lines.' Koeman was speaking at St Mary's after meeting Barclays Spirit of the Game hero Tina Croucher, who was being rewarded for her community work at the club. The Southampton manager and midfielder Victor Wanyama answered questions from a handful of supporters as part of the event, where talk of Pochettino was rarely far away. Koeman says his return along with the potential implications of the result makes Saturday's match the biggest at St Mary's since he took the reins. A positive result would see Saints break their record Premier League points haul set last year by Pochettino, although he is unlikely to get a particularly warm reception. The former Argentina defender's departure left a sour taste with many Southampton fans, whose travelling support gave him a taster of what to expect at White Hart Lane earlier in the season. 'Sometimes if you go as a Barcelona player to Madrid the reception is difficult, and sometimes in Holland,' Koeman said, when asked if he has such a bad reception. 'But, okay, I think the reception for Mauricio normally has to be good because he did a great job for Southampton. 'I like him as a person and as a coach and we have a good contact.' Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama (centre) shields the ball from Swansea players back in September. There certainly does not appear any bad blood between Koeman and Pochettino, despite the latter suggesting earlier in the year that he handed the Dutchman an easy job at Southampton. Koeman took those comments in his stride, joking at the time that he only came to Southampton 'to have a nice little holiday'. Now, just days before the game, the Saints boss gave a more serious answer, praising his Spurs counterpart for the legacy he left at St Mary's. 'I think they make the beginning (of this) and developed the quality of the players, the young players,' Koeman said. 'I think the structure and organisation in the team, the spirit of the players starts under Mauricio. 'I took that over and maybe we were different in some details. From what I heard, maybe I try to do more training sessions with the ball and maybe he was a little bit more physical. 'I think the start, for the development of the team, was under Mauricio and he did a great job last season. 'We continue (that) and so far we made it a little bit better than it was, but that is all about the experience and quality of the players.' .

The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February. Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago. The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time. 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.'

They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on.

CLIFF,cnndm,675550549d4f9d3722445d6b5da24b9fac62a52f,"Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. ""Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too."" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. ""Everyday Americans need a champion,"" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, ""and I want to be that champion."" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's ""image"" as her or his ""substance."" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.","Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day; women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn.

Fowler told goal.com: 'Everyone would absolutely love Steven to win it, what with this being his last season and possibly last game, and hopefully that will be the case. 'But Liverpool have got to get themselves into the position where they can't do this just for Steven Gerrard. They've got to do it for every individual involved with the club. That's the way it should be.' Gerrard will miss the trip to Ewood Park as he serves the second match of a three-game suspension and Fowler hopes that Jordan Henderson and Co put their missing captain to the back of their minds. 'If you put too much effort in for one man, maybe you can get a little bit too excited or overboard,' added Fowler.

'I was brought up at Anfield and still work there, so what else am I going to think?, but he’d be crazy to go at this stage in his development, especially because he’s being guided by a special manager who has already turned Luis Suarez into one of the best players in the world... and earned Luis the money to go with that status.'  .",Liverpool face Blackburn in the FA Cup quarter - final on Wednesday.

Mourinho had to answer questions about his three midfielders after the hard-fought 2-1 home win over Stoke.

Cesc Fabregas runs with the ball, but the assists have dried up for the Spanish international in recent weeks. ‘For me football is not just mathematics. When some people write that Fabregas drops his level because the number of assists are not the same, the number of assists are probably not the same because the player that he assists does not score.’. ‘Matic, he was suspended, and after the suspension he was injured celebrating in the final, so he went back and he was not in the best condition. ‘I always think stability is very important in a team, and it’s not in April that you are going to make important changes.’.

When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross. Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season. If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right. .  .

Benteke was at the double in the opening 45, sweeping beyond Green to put Villa ahead just after the half hour. Defender Clint Hill was the unexpected scorer of QPR's equaliser just after half-time to make it 2-2. Hill grabs the Queens Park Rangers badge in celebration after scoring his first ever Premier League goal. Charlie Austin got ahead of Ron Vlaar and had looked as if he'd won the game for QPR. At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. . The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. . Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points . But Benteke's wonder free-kick, much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night, meant Villa came away with a point.

Good friends Chris Ramsey (left) and Sherwood know each other well and were going head-to-head in the dugout for the first time.

Villa Park looked a picture on Tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head-to-head in Birmingham . Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal – his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post.

CLIFF,cnndm,5a3d3b7a4ae2c36d206bfc289e43b8ec6cec1223,"It's all Pep Guardiola's fault; him and the good folk of Scotland or, at least, St Andrews. It is a simplification, of course, but perhaps a useful way of understanding why, as we survey the Champions League quarter finals, there are no Premier League clubs troubling the scorers. Bayern Munich take on Porto on Wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben among others you might anticipate a sixth Champions League semi-final for Guardiola in his six years of management. Of course Guardiola isn't alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe; nor is it really down to St Andrews, though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs. Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto. The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday. Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn't that the Barcelona team changed. Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them. What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews, where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola. There Messi was a distracted individual, sometimes sneering at Guardiola's insistence on organisation and pressing, according to Guillem Balague's account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola. But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics. The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing, sidling up to him after training, putting his arm round him to assure him of his support. Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi-final in his six years as a manager. Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics. Messi, the precocious star, suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola. And, as a result, he began to buy into Guardiola's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football, which was already a template at Barcelona. For tiki taka is not what made Guardiola’s team great. 'I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's rubbish and has no purpose.' It sounds like Sam Allardyce, but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by Marti Perarnau in his book Pep Confidential. What Guardiola added to Barcelona’s game was the intensity, drive and sheer energy which had wilted under Rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession. Sometimes, when assessing the English problem in Europe, it helps to reverse the question. So, rather than ask 'Why are we so bad now?' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005-2009?' Guardiola led Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011 (pictured) The former Barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success. For Chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph, that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of English clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier, bucking the established trend. Between 2005-2009 the Premier League provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the Champions League; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24. Even asking that question is revealing as what English clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy. Only Liverpool and Manchester United actually achieved that in the five-year period of English ascendancy, though, of course, Chelsea did so improbably in 2012. What was different about English clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the Premier League. Jose Mourinho may never have won the trophy with Chelsea but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win. Rafael Benitez was an extraordinary force, the Diego Simeone of that era, regularly out-witting Mourinho and taking a relatively normal Liverpool team to two finals. Guus Hiddink engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of Mourinho. Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 when English clubs were dominating the latter stages. Chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds. Rising to the challenge of Mourinho and Benitez, Sir Alex Ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period, playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before Guardiola and others made it fashionable. English teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope. What they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous. Benitez, Mourinho, Hiddink provided that and Ferguson responded. Put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which, allied to the commercial success of the Premier League, was pushing players and teams to new heights. The Premier League’s TV money of course brought in good, technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success. The money is bigger now and those players still come but it hasn't helped Manchester City. At the zenith of the Premier League's dominance, the 2008 Moscow final, ten English players started the game. Manchester City were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of Barcelona. Chelsea exited at the same stage as England have no representatives in the quarter-finals. When Jurgen Klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in Germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich - he explicitly referenced the Premier League and its pace. He recognised that continental Europe had fallen behind. It was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the English game which helped the Premier League dominate Europe. Conversely, it was Guardiola - and others, such as Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the Premier League. Clubs such as Barca, Bayern, Dortmund have retained their technical superiority over English clubs but they are now likely to out-run them and out-press them. In reality there is no one man responsible for that change. And, Guardiola's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for South American football and especially Marcelo Bielsa, rather than the Premier League. But when that change took place, the Premier League lost its competitive edge. And when Guardiola put his arm around Messi at St Andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game, European football changed forever.",Bayern Munich take on Porto in the Champions League quarter - final.

United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years.

United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games. Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014. 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning. Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country. I was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad, but I have just got to make sure I am playing well here at United and hopefully I will get the call at some time soon.'  .",Manchester City have won the last four Manchester derbies.

CLIFF,cnndm,e0a5406bd964ee77d6af8079972138d3972179bb,"Tony Pulis returned to Selhurst Park for the first time since he left Crystal Palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his West Bromwich Albion side to the edge of safety. Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort .

It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.’ Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis’ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon’s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. ‘That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. ‘We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch.

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.’ Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. . If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three. .

CLIFF,cnndm,83d6436741b1022766c9baa31ffc00748fa415ec,"On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled ""Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,"" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal ""what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,"" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans ""targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction."" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book ""Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,"" notes, ""the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems."" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? ""Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!"" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. ""This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it."" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",An NPR report on the unrest in Baltimore focused on tensions between blacks and Asians. Ruben Navarrette: There's little evidence that Asian businesses were targeted out of racial animus. He says the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the 1980s.

To be fair, however, this probably wasn’t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls. The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks. Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. . Traffic Scotland tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold-ups ‘due to a dog taking control of tractor’, adding: ‘Nope, not joking.’ . Appropriately, they couldn’t resist the hashtag: ‘#maycausetailbacks’. Observers and Twitter commentators joined the pun fun by speculating: ‘Police investigating – so far no leads’; or the inevitable: ‘This is barking.’ .

The vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow. Moments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. . Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: ‘I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn’t put the brake on. ‘When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn’t catch up.’ . Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking' Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton Farm.

For the next 48 hours, however, the pint will have to stay behind the bar as Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood go toe to toe in the scrap for survival. As far as QPR manager Ramsey is concerned, Sherwood’s Aston Villa are in no danger of tumbling out of the Barclays Premier League, despite their lowly position. . The verdict is delivered on the evidence that Ramsey has gathered in four years of working alongside Sherwood at Tottenham. Chris Ramsey believes his friend and neighbour Tim Sherwood will keep Aston Villa in the Premier League. But the QPR boss will be pulling no punches when he clashes with his former Tottenham colleague on Tuesday. QPR scored four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since March 1994 v Norwich (4-3). . ‘Without a shadow of a doubt I think he will keep them up,’ said Ramsey. ‘He has a good squad, players who have the wow factor and he knows how to manipulate those particular players. . 'If I was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do, I would be putting a bet on him keeping them up.’. Ramsey will be doing his utmost to extend Villa’s top-flight uncertainty on Tuesday night and has reason for optimism given Rangers’ stunning victory at West Bromwich Albion. . Ramsey says if he 'was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do,' he would bet on Villa staying up. QPR celebrate the second of their four goals against West Brom from Charle Austin (right) A second win in the Birmingham area in four days would send QPR above Villa on goal difference. Sherwood and Ramsey, a duo operating as boss and assistant last season at Spurs, will share words in advance. ‘Me, him and Les (Ferdinand) live probably 10 minutes from each other so sometimes there is a pint to be had. I’m sure we’ll speak before the game,’ added Ramsey. ‘We worked together at Tottenham for four years in various jobs,’ said Ramsey. ‘It’s great you can have two coaches who’ve gone through the system and are coaching in the Premier League. The game has to look at it from an English point of view. ‘If things hadn’t gone our way against West Brom then the mountain looks a little bit bigger. The game will be very important for both teams.’. Ramsey and Sherwood were in the trenches together at Spurs and live within 10 minutes of each other. The perspective for Ramsey’s team is more positive after putting four past a West Brom side who for the first half looked to have beach on the brain already. . Joey Barton scored in added time at the Hawthorns to underline the emphatic victory, having six minutes earlier received a forearm in the face from Youssouf Mulumbu that saw the Albion midfielder sent off. That ended any chance of a comeback for the hosts, who trailed 3-0 at the break but pulled one back through Victor Anichebe.

CLIFF,cnndm,37a8f67bffe7956dc4d81adc063588b34f366b42,"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. . 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him – but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur’s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea’s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas’ late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances – as many as the rest of Chelsea’s back four put together – and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger’s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal’s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over – one more than they’d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany’s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January – a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them – a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom’s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion’s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football’s black and white days – every one of Albion’s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow – and captain Darren Fletcher’s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It’s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total – Christian Benteke’s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman’s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn’t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue – Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals’ youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months – just in time to be available for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke’s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One – it’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe’s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who’ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani – and he’s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places.

He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time. It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe. The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. Reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties.

When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’. Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’. Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled. .

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time. Federici’s mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. . Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored.

Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal. It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici.

Spanish press reports indicate Chelsea are their only rivals for the Frenchman's signature. Pogba is one of Europe's most in demand young talents but Spanish paper SPORT say that the leaders in La Liga and the Barclays Premier League are the only two viable destinations for the 22-year-old Frenchman. With Barcelona currently under the restrictions of a FIFA-imposed transfer ban until the January window, Pogba would have to be loaned back to Juve until the 2016-17 season as part of any prospective deal. . SPORT say Barcelona will make a £50m offer for Paul Pogba while Marca look at the race for La Liga. Pogba is said to be the subject of a £50m bid from Barca with Chelsea their only realistic transfer rivals. Lionel Messi returned to training for Barcelona after a foot problem ahead of facing Celta Vigo. SPORT claim that Pogba has listened to Barca's offer but is yet to decide on his future with four years remaining on his contract with the Italian champions. The Catalan daily also say that Lionel Messi has recovered from a problem with swelling on his foot to start for Barca in their return to La Liga against Celta Vigo on Sunday after making it through a training session unscathed. Also in Spain, Marca look at Real Madrid's quest to overhaul their perennial rivals at the top of La Liga. They say that if Real win their final 10 games to take a total points haul of 94, they can count on winning the title. That might be easier said than done, however. No team has won their last 10 games in La Liga in the last decade, no matter how sure Real are that Barca will falter. L'Equipe look ahead to a big weekend in the French title race, A Bola pin Benfica's hopes on Nicolas Gaitan. David Luiz and PSG have made their way to the top of Ligue 1 but that position will be challenge this weekend. Marseille and their star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac will want to knock PSG off the top of the table. It's a huge weekend in France with Le Classique top of the bill, Lyon getting the opportunity to top the table and Monaco taking on St Etienne. With that in mind, L'Equipe go with the headline: 'The hunt is on'. Champions PSG are still in with a shout of an unprecedented treble, sitting top of Ligue 1 with eight games to go, in the semi-finals of the French Cup and having reached the last eight of the Champions League. But their abilities are certain to be tested on Sunday night in a first vs third clash against Marseille at a packed 67,394-capacity Stade Velodrome. A difficult April schedule makes it important that PSG stay top of the table in Marseille, having struggled to maintain a title challenge for much of the season. Gaitan is viewed as the key man for Benfica as they look to open up a gap on Porto in Portugal. Manager Jorge Jesus said Gaitan is a star of different characteristics to his other players, with no equal. With nearest rivals Porto faltering, A Bola in France focus on Nicolas Gaitan's position as Benfica's leader as they look to wrap up the Primeira Liga title in the coming weeks. Benfica boss Jorge Jesus said of Gaitan: 'Nico is a player of different characteristics, we have no equal to him. 'He's a player with a lot of influence and he can be with us for many years.

Everyone was into little Wilshere, with West Ham (the team his dad Andy supports), Tottenham and Arsenal all offering to give Luton’s academy kid a shot at the highest level. Wilshere was a Hitchin boy, spotted early by Luton’s scouts before Arsenal took him to their Hale End academy at nine. At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger’s side. Charlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town. Soon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder. The Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season. ‘We just want what’s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,’ said dad Julio on Wednesday. ‘He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.’. Charlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. ‘Other parents have commented on it in the past,’ admitted Julio. The big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA’s compensation guidelines. The transfer fee involved is £10,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton. There are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision. Charlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost £10,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton. 11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona. Julio’s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports. Julio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: ‘Charlie doesn’t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.’. Charlie’s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents’ home in London Colney, Hertfordshire. Soon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball. He has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton’s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club. Julio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London’s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago. Charlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball. He trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road) The Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time. ‘Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,’ added his dad. ‘He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.’. The Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club’s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed. Julio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club. ‘Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,’ he added. ‘They have really looked after Charlie over the years.’.

CLIFF,cnndm,bc16017daf093ed9afc7a6e8ce3cdc78b21c382c,"REJECTION PROOF. by Jia Jiang. (Random House, £13.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it’s galling. And in every case there’s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn’t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn’t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there’s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) . The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of ‘quest’ books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn’t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch’s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying ‘Free refill’, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. ‘When are you looking for these?’ she asked. ‘In the next . . . 15 minutes?’. ‘Let me see what I can do,’ she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it’s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang’s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else’s opinion, and it may not be the right one.  .","Jia Jiang spent 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog.

ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work.  . 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March. Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did. Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution. The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. . 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' . Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts.  .  .","Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved. It's understood he penned a letter at the weekend in which he said that if the president were to' postpone the executions indefinitely', he would come out in support of the decision. Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he was told earlier in the year by human rights advocates that Mr PrabOWo was' very sympathetic' to clemency.

CLIFF,cnndm,4bf31c1ec86cf9123bd6ef0d227b6dc9dc9b37de,"There can be no doubt that the bone-jarring collisions we see on Saturday will be far more substantial than the flick from David Beckham's right boot which led to Diego Simeone collapsing in apparent agony on the same pitch 17 years ago. This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash . CLERMONT AUVERGNE: N Abendanon; N Nakaitaci, J Davies, W Fofana, N Nalaga; B James, L Radosavljevic; V Debaty, B Kayser, D Zirakashvili, J Cudmore, S Vahaamahina, J Bonnaire, D Chouly (capt), J Bardy. SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt — captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. . With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games. In these big games it's often about adapting to the situation and we know we have got a few strings to our bow.' Against a Clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field, Saracens will need all those strings.

Huge waves as high as 40 feet smashed glass panels, shattered plates and cups – and left many on-board violently seasick as the boat pitched from side to side. A Sydney harbour pilot finally boarded this morning and the ship, carrying 2,500 holidaymakers and 1,500 crew, docked at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at around 10am. . Scroll down for videos    . The 2500 passengers on board a cruise ship, which has been stranded at sea due to wild weather conditions, have finally arrived at Sydney Harbour this morning. Holidaymakers were due to disembark the Carnival Spirit on Tuesday morning but the Sydney storm prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. The port in Sydney reopened on Wednesday morning, allowing the ship made its way through the harbour to dock. Passengers from the cruise ship Carnival Spirit disembark at Sydney's Overseas Passenger Terminal. 'We're so relieved to just get off,' passenger Courtney Randall said as she disembarked the liner. 'Inside everyone was sick, it was really quite rocky.' 'Everyone is ready to get off,' Debbie from Cherrybrook told ABC radio as the ship headed towards the shore. Another passenger told the Sydney Morning Herald  of the horror and panic of being on board while the ship was battered had left her traumatised. 'At one stage, I looked out the window and one of the waves crashed up against the glass. I freaked out and closed the curtains. I couldn't deal with it,' Athanasia Georgoudakis, from Yagoona in Sydney's south-west, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'This is the last [cruise]. If I want to go on holiday I will catch a plane. I will not take another cruise, never.' Vacationers were put on edge as 'a lot of water' coming through glass panels and some of the crew were also frightened by the experience. One passenger has told how many travellers have been 'vomiting for two days' due to rough seas conditions. A spokesperson for the cruise liner said that boarding is expected to commence at 2.30pm for their modified 7-day Isle de Pines vacation, with plans to set sail by 7pm.  A camera on the cruise captures the moment it finally enters Sydney Harbour on Wednesday morning. One member of staff, who had worked on cruise ships for six years said that he had been sea sick and was very relieved to be back on shore. 'I was pretty scared of the roughness because I've experienced nothing like that before,' he told Daily Mail Australia, asking not to be identified. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday. . It had been due to dock on Tuesday morning but Sydney Harbour was closed to traffic as conditions were so bad. The crew had pleaded for calm on board the ship, saying it was built to withstand the storm, which has been described as a 'once in a century' weather event. Daily Mail Australia spoke to several new passengers, who were among many waiting to check in their luggage for their week-long journey aboard the ship.

The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged and stranded outside Sydney Harbour on Tuesday morning. The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves. While the ship was stuck at sea, one passenger told the Daily Telegraph that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it's the roughest he's seen.' . At 8.25am on Wednesday, Carnival Cruise Line Australia finally posted a message on their Facebook page that their ship had been cleared to dock. ‘(We) have been notified that the port in Sydney is now open to ship traffic and we're happy to say the weather has improved to allow safe entry into the port,' it read. The Carnival Spirit has 2500 passengers on board, stranded outside of Sydney Harbour because of the city's wild weather. 'The pilot is now on board and ship is proceeding to the terminal and is expected to be alongside no later than 10am. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.’.

Dr Marie-Therese Proctor, of Picton which is 80km south-west of Sydney, is travelling with her teenage daughter Serena and told Daily Mail Australia she is confident the weather is going to clear up. 'It's disappointing that we lost one day of travel as we were supposed to leave yesterday and we would have cancelled our trip all together if it didn't sail today,' Dr Proctor said.

Seven-year-old Charlotte Briggs was told she cannot attend Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window. . Her mother Lynne, 49, who has two other children, claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job. Unhappy: Charlotte Briggs, seven, was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away, so her mother Lynne, pictured together,  must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back. Decision: The schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to Shooters Grove Primary, which is around two miles away. Mrs Briggs had believed Broomhill Infants School in Sheffield, where Charlotte is a student, was a feeder school to Lydgate Junior, so only put one school on Charlotte's admission form. The mother - who works in IT for Sheffield City Council and is married to financial planner Simon, 55, - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor. But the council said the school Charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying. Charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed, so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her. Mrs Briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away. She said: 'I know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment, we live about as close to the school as possible. . Rejected: Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School (above) in Sheffield, even though she can see it from her bedroom window. 'Parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at Lydgate Juniors. 'The council uses an ""as the crow flies"" criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if I look out of my landing window, all that stands between us and the school are the Kings Court OAP flats and a couple of houses. 'I've been told Broomhill is no longer a feeder school and all the places have been allocated at other infant schools. 'I have looked at bus timetables. I wouldn't be able to drop Charlotte off at school and get into town for work. It would take an hour and five minutes each way twice a day. I simply wouldn't be able to do it.'

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. . Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. . His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. . She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. . Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. . 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges. 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.'  . When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'","Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions.

The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper played every round of Newcastle’s run but was dropped in favour of Steve Harper for the Wembley showpiece, won 2-0 by Sir Alex Ferguson’s side. Given has yet to experience a truly fulfilling visit to the national stadium. He played in the 1998 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, as well as the semi-final defeat to Chelsea in 2000. Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . He has an FA Cup winners’ medal from 2011 but was an unusued substitute for the final against Stoke with Joe Hart in net. He is out to make amends against Liverpool. ‘It was nice to be part of winning it with Man City but when you don’t play it doesn’t have the same value,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where my medal is to be honest. ‘1999 was a bit of a slap in the face. Do you ever get over it, I suppose? It’s not an easy one. Ruud Gullit didn’t even tell me, he got the goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe to tell me I wasn’t playing. ‘But you can’t look back in football, you’ve just got to look forward. I’d love to win a trophy and make a bit of history at Aston Villa.’. The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets. Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39. Manager Tim Sherwood has confirmed Given, who turns 39 tomorrow, will keep his Cup place rather than be replaced by No 1 Brad Guzan. Given has played every round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and make key saves along the way. . Given admitted he felt matches of this magnitude had passed him by when he was out on loan at Middlesbrough last season, as Lambert jettisoned players he needed to remove off the wage bill. Last April, he was in the dugout assisting Villa’s former manager as coach when Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended. ‘I am employed by Aston Villa and I felt I could help out,’ said Given. ‘Life is too short to have grudges.’. Sherwood watched his Villa side in training as they prepare for the Sunday's crunch clash. Sherwood, his former Blackburn teammate, has provided a ‘new lease of life’. . ‘Tim is a very ambitious guy, he wants to keep the club in the Premier League and win the FA Cup. There have been occasions this season where people have seen the angry side. But ten minutes later he is putting his arm around the same player. One of his best skills is man management. He knows how to get the best out of people.’. Given has regained his place in the Ireland team and is wants to play at Euro 2016 should his country qualify. He would also like to take the goalkeeping shirt off Brad Guzan in the Premier League. He has a year left on his contract this summer and will discuss his prospects with Sherwood. ‘This run has shown I’m still capable and hopefully it gives a seed of doubt into the manager’s head as well that if he wants to mix it up in the Premier League.’ .

Adam Leheup, 34, allegedly  insisted on having sex with the 25-year-old woman despite her shouting: 'No, no.'  . Leheup met the woman on July 9, 2013 after arranging to meet on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Adam Leheup met with his alleged victim after making contact with her through the 'Let's Date App' They arranged to meet under the clock on Waterloo Station before crossing the bridge over to the Embankment where they went to Gordon's Wine Bar. . Leheup, who is a University of Greenwich graduate and technical co-ordinator on the £500m Nine Elms Point development, denies raping the woman. . Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Leheup missed his last train home to Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, so the alleged victim allowed him to come home with her to her flat in Camden during the early hours of July 10, 2013. He said they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. In a statement to police, the alleged victim said: 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked. He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: ""No"" a lot, but he was not listening. 'I was saying: ""No"", but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: ""Girl’s say: No, but they don’t mean it."" I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Prosecutor Mr Ish Sheikh told the court the couple met on dating app ‘Let’s Date’ - which connects users who mutually find each other attractive - and had two bottles of wine at Gordons Wine Bar, Embankment after meeting and walking across Waterloo Bridge. It was so late Leheup had missed his last train and his date agreed to put him up for the night. 'She made it clear nothing would happen and they went to a second bar, ""Joe’s"", in Camden where they had mojitos. Leheup went to Gordon's Wine Bar, pictured, with his alleged victim before going back to Camden together. Leheup has pleaded not guilty to raping the 25-year-old girl at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured. 'He started kissing my neck and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but it wasn’t vicious or nasty and later I did kiss him back. We were getting on well,' the woman told police in a video interview. 'The kissing had got a bit more aggressive, stuff I did not like, his hand on my throat, which makes me vulnerable. 'I said: ""Nothing is going to happen."" I’m not that kind of girl. Mr Sheikh added: 'The defendant was also a bit funny towards her when she was talking to other men at the bar.' They returned to the complainant’s flat in the early hours. 'She shares it with two others and when they got into the bedroom she changed into jogging bottoms and a top and got into bed, where the defendant joined her without any clothes on at all. 'He started kissing her and got on top of her and she was shouting: ""No, no,"" and to stop, but he did not take any heed of these cries and touched her with his fingers.' Partial intercourse occurred for a very short time and the young woman managed to get away and told Leheup: 'Why did you do that when I said no?' Mr Sheikh explained: 'One of the flatmates was woken because of the shouting and told Mr Leheup to leave, but he wouldn’t because he said he had work the next day and wanted to wait until the trains started running. The flatmate threatened to call the police and Leheup clambered down scaffolding outside the balcony door, but was arrested on the way to the underground station. When questioned by police the defendant said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. 'He said he was fondling her breasts and there was no talk of sex one way or the other. 'When they arrived at the bedroom he said she said words to the effect of: ""Welcome to my crack den."" 'He said he took her bra off because she wanted a back massage with some oil and they began kissing. 'He said he got on top of her her and she then freaked out and as soon as she did he got off her,' explained Mr. Sheikh. 'He said he climbed down the scaffolding to avoid a confrontation. 'When she was shouting: ""No"" he should have known she was not consenting. He was not going to take no for an answer that night.' The young woman admits she was under the influence of alcohol. 'I was probably more drunk than I should have been. I was feeling a bit giddy, a bit tipsy, but I was not falling over.' The trial continues.  .

But attempting to recreate these amazing pictures is now much more difficult - and in some cases impossible - as a result of a clampdown on the use of drones for photographic purposes. New Zealand photographer Amos Chapple travelled the world during the 18 months with a quadcopter in his backpack between 2012 and 2014 when it was easier to take aerial pictures using a drone. Since then restrictive laws and regulations have been implemented across the world, due to privacy concerns, commercial rights and worries about damage to property or crashes in the air with other aircraft. . From capturing the street scene in Barcelona to the majestic glory of the Taj Mahel, his photographs of some of the world’s most far-flung and enchanting places could become ‘one of a kind’ as he re-posted them under a new blog post: 'My Aerial Drone Shots Would Be Totally Illegal Today'. ‘There was a window of about 18 months where it was possible to fly these things anywhere and people were excited to see it’, Mr Chapple told Business Insider. ‘I’m glad I made use of that time.’.

High above Barcelona, clouds while through the pillars of Sagrat Cor Church. The authorities in charge of sites and cities like that have introduced tough new regulations to stop similar pictures being taken in the future, over privacy concerns and commercial rights. Mr Chapple travelled across Europe on his photographic mission, visiting the star fort at Bourtange, Netherlands, for these pictures. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque - or the 'Blue Mosque' - in Istanbul, Turkey is seen against a much wider backdrop thanks to this birds-eye view. The aerial view of Barcelona showcase the octagonial city blocks, designed to allow light and space on the street corners.

With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff. Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014. .  .",Alexander Kristoff beat off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders.

The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due 'mid to late April' during a visit last month. Kate, 33, who was touring the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford with Prince William, added: 'Not long to go now.' Although April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date, royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such.

'The Duchess herself said mid to late April and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we've never confirmed anything and we never will.' However, the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, although tomorrow and Friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1. The Duchess is currently thought to be staying at Kensington Palace, a short drive from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital where she is due to give birth. Popular: The 25th is the favourite but the Palace says neither that date or any other has been confirmed. Preparations: The police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the Lindo Wing yesterday. Yesterday, police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the Duchess' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart.

'The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated,' the statement read. 'This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned. 'As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.' Fans: Royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital, among them Terry Hut, 71. Ready to go: The scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for Prince George in 2013. Back in town: The Palace has said Prince Harry will be in London this weekend before returning to Australia. But concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign, with Prince William due to attend a wreath-laying service at the Cenotaph on Saturday.

CCTV footage from several cameras inside the restaurant showed Nellist beating the dog. Mr Fletcher said: 'There is no audio recorded on it, but it’s horrible to watch.

Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre.

No chorus of boos or whistles would stop the sweet strike rising above the 1950s tower blocks in the Colombes suburbs, with the ice cool 31-year-old mobbed by players and coaches as Racing Metro 92 were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition. It was the South American’s finest moment since he arrived on continental shores. Referee Nigel Owens was escorted off the pitch by security but his call –penalising replacement lock Fabrice Metz with 10 seconds left on the clock – was the correct decision and ensured a classic finale to match bereft or flair and finesse. . Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92.

Tries: Nil Penalties: Hodgson (2), Goode, Bosch Conversions: Nil . ‘The last time I kicked to win the game was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina,’ said Bosch. 'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’. It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland. The retired No 10, now kicking coach for the Top 14 side, watched helplessly from the stands of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir as the ball sailed between the posts to set up a knockout meeting with Clermont in Saint Etienne. .

They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb.  . Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins. .

We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’. Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later.

The photo shoot which took place in Sydney's Luna Park provided the perfect backdrop for the crazy, clown-like antics of the collaboration. 'They closed the park for the day so we had a couple of hours to take over and shoot. It provided the perfect creepy abandoned backdrop.' Model shy:The girls admit while they love wearing clothes, they are actually camera shy. Theme this: Sydney's theme park 'Luna Park' was the backdrop for their crazy colour pop collaboration. The shoes featured are also as part of the collaboration and are from the brand 'Buffalo Shoes' which are the same brand who sky-rocketed platforms into the mainstream  when they were famously worn by the Spice Girls during the 90s. 'We'd been collaborating with the guys from Buffalo shoes but we weren't sure what our following would think, so we posted a pic on Instagram and everyone has been dying over them - so it's had a great response,' says Jess. . While the  photo shoot for their current collaboration only took a quick 45 minutes, the Dadon sisters had a lot of other projects  keeping them busy. Down-to-earth duo:  45 minutes is all it took to string together the glamour shots as seen throughout. Pop princesses: The platforms  made by Buffalo Shoes are the same company made famous by the Spice Girls. First there's their new shoe label, titled 'Twoobs,' coming out in  June in America. 'We  did a shoe collaboration with Windsor Smith a year and a half ago and once we got a taste for shoes we fell in love,' says Jess. 'This first line will be all about sandals with  flat and platform soles,'she said. According to Jess,  platforms are a must because they're much more comfortable than heels - 'you’re feet won't be sore at the end of the night and you still get the height.' Flair for fashion: With a natural knack for fashion the girls are now releasing a 'how-to' book titled #howtolive. Colour craziness: 'How To Live' have become well known thanks to their colourful Australian style. Questioned why America is their first market, the sisters admit escaping to summer weather is their biggest appeal, especially as their based most of the year in Melbourne (known for it's southerly chill). 'We’re going to go for three months then decide if we'll stay on permanently. We love L.A., and we already have a fan base and  connections to the shoe industry over there so it just made sense,' says Stef. They also have a book in the works, with the very insta-worthy title ' #howtwolive' coming out in September. . Celebrity scene: In their short two and a half years of blogging they've met  Rachel Zoe and Anna Dello Russo. The book offers 36 'how-two' projects including fashion, recipes and nail art ideas. As for more collaborations? There's more on the cards but according to the girls it's still under tight wraps at the moment. Not that the fashion bloggers will need any help with exposure. The duo have met a lot of fashion royalty in the two and a half years since their blog's conception - with highlights including   Rachel Zoe at New York Fashion Week and  Anna Dello Russo when they guest edited for Elle Girl Japan. Fame and fortune aside, at the end of the day all the girls really care about is representing fashion. 'In the Australian blogging scene, everyone does the same thing, so we decided early on our goal was to bring colour into the Australian market,' says Jess. Patriotic pair: Despite business endeavours in the U.S. they take pride in representing Australian designers. And it's their vibrant and uniquely Australian approach that seems to be working. 'When we met Rachel Zoe we were wearing an amazing Australian designer Natasha Fagg and she came up to us and was like ‘""I love what you’re wearing, you girls look so crazy,""' says Jess. . 'It also helps that we were wearing big sunnies, very Rachel Zoe, she adds. 'We love to promote Australian designers when we're overseas. When we guest edited Elle Girl, it was so cool to have people from Japan come up and ask us who we were wearing,' she said. Despite their recent success, the duo from Melbourne remain down-to-earth about their life and even admit that despite receiving the odd gifts here and there they prefer to buy all their own clothes. 'It's flattering to receive gifts but we're a bit picky and it's always better to buy what you love and stay true to what your style is,' says Jess. .","Jess, 22, and Stef, 27, Dadon have teamed up with New York - based company' Print All Over Me' They are also launching a new shoe line' Twoobs' in America. The photo shoot was their own idea, which they' threw together' because they didn't think the collaboration on its own had enough of their signature look.

Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League. United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield. The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half. However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday. 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.'

Just three months after Silver himself was arrested on corruption charges, his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch, 37, was accused of running a $7million Ponzi scheme. . The Brooklyn resident was in court on Monday as prosecutors accused him of lying to investors about stock losses and pocketing most of the money entrusted to him for trading. Trebitsch is married to Silver's daughter Michelle. Despite being a co-owner of their mutual fund, Allese Capital LLC, and a certified public accountant who 'kept the books', Michelle has not been charged in the scheme. .

According to the complaint, Trebitsch took millions from investors, promising to invest their money in large-cap stocks through his mutual fund. . However, prosecutors say he only invested a fraction of the money and used the rest to finance his family and pay back other clients. Meanwhile, he allegedly lied to investors about what money he did invest, sending them fake account statements and tax forms that showed them posting positive returns along the lines of his promised 14 to 16 per cent - keeping 'enormous trading losses' secret. Trebitsch ran the scheme from 2009 through December 2014, according to the complaint. . Trebitsch has been charged with securities and wire fraud and is currently free on $500,000 bond.

CLIFF,cnndm,be50bd56517bf4240402fbdeadaffd7f705e8d9a,"Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers. Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract. Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania  . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United. Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club. If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract. I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

CLIFF,cnndm,15adbace5ad32429ac3e85d964602b70bbae469f,"It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway,. But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night. Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback. Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern. Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' . Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto. Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova. And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.  .",Thiago Alcantara scored in Bayern Munich's 6 - 1 win over Porto on Wednesday.

Elle said: '(The most surprising thing in my handbag is) a pH balance urine tester kit to check that I'm in an alkaline state. I believe that most ailments come from having an acidic body.' The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. . An alkaline body can be achieved by eating the right foods (lots of leafy greens) and exercising.

The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking to FEMAIL at the time about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do?

Munroe Bergdorf, the super sexy brunette as she looks now (left) and in 1999 when she was still a boy called Ian (right) . Transgender Munroe has made a name for herself on London's party scene and now spins the decks in some of the country's most high end clubs. Munroe said: 'I had always known growing up that I was supposed to be a woman, but I'd always tried to hide it for fear of being different. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate. 'But I remember being about 17 and wondering how different my life would be if I didn't care what people think. . 'It was then that it suddenly hit me - it was time to start being true to myself,' she said. 'I came out as gay to begin with at 15 and then I started dressing up as a woman and doing drag around three years later,' said Munroe. 'Soon I started the slow process to transition into a woman, it was the best decision I've ever made. Now (left) and then (right): Munroe has transformed into a sexy beauty after growing up as a boy. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate,' she says. Munroe (pictured at a party last year) began her transition at the age of 19, and at 25 years old was offered hormones by her doctor. 'I'm now a DJ full time and I do some work within the fashion industry too,' said Munroe. 'I've worked for Calvin Klein in their press office, designed a lip gloss for Illamasqua, a make-up brand that I love, and I've even designed capsule lines for Boy London - Rihanna has worn one of my pieces. 'I also do a bit of modelling from time to time. 'Some people notice that I was once a boy, some people don't - but I'm happy to talk about it if they ask.' Munroe began living as a woman at the age of 18 and started taking drugs friends had been prescribed at 23. It was only at 25 she was offered the hormones by her doctor. She said: 'I first started taking hormones that had been prescribed to my other trans friends. . The DJ explained: 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change' The stunning brunette (left and right) modelled for a variety of fashion and beauty brands including Illamasqua and Boy London - made famous by Rihanna. 'It is not something that I would recommend at all, but the process can take such a long time, and once you've made the decision to become the person you really are, you just want to get on with it. 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change - and soon as I was given them by my doctor. 'It's like going through puberty again so I got quite self-conscious about the way I looked and dressed, and I felt as though I started to think differently.' 'I didn't really like explaining what was going on to people as I was doing this for myself, but friends and family were curious,' she said. 'My mum found out what was going on when she noticed my chest growing - it was a shock at first but she's very supportive. 'As soon as I noticed the change in myself it was like I wasn't ashamed any more,' she said. Munroe has now been taking hormones for four years, and has embraced her new life. She said: 'When I left university I got involved in fashion and the PR industry. 'I've had the opportunity of working with some incredible brands, designers and photographers, and I just love it. 'I've done everything from club promotion, modelling, PR, and now I'm a full time DJ. 'I DJ at major club nights and private members clubs in some of the most exclusive venues in London - I feel so lucky for everything that's come my way, I would never take it for granted. 'I'm still the same person I was before, I'm just in the right body now. 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise'. Munroe, pictured with her friend Conor, says of her transition: 'It was the best decision I've ever made' Munroe and her friend Stephano at London Fashion Week. The DJ believes: 'I want people to know that it's ok to be different, and that you shouldn't be scared of being the person you are' 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise,' says Munroe. Munroe now hopes her story will encourage other young transgender men and women to feel comfortable in their own skin. Munroe said: 'I think it's important that the world understands and respects transgender people and the rights that they deserve to have within society. 'I'm so much happier now than I was growing up. 'I want people to know that it's okay to be different, and that you shouldn't be scared of being the person you are. 'I talk quite openly now about what's I've been through and frequently speak publicly about trans rights and community issues.

Now the adventure has been re-created in a new film, showing the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they wander incognito through the city streets. And among the most curious viewers of A Royal Night Out, released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945, will be a woman who knows better than anyone what really happened on that extraordinary night. Scroll down for video . Royal Role: Canadian Sarah Gadon, left. plays a young Princess Elizabeth, pictured right. Dancing Queen: Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth enjoying a night out to celebrate the end of the Second World War. Because she was there. ‘It was a Cinderella moment in reverse,’ says The Hon Margaret Rhodes, 89, first cousin to the Queen and her best friend. ‘It was wonderful bedlam. I can’t remember whose idea it was. It was just one of those things that happened.’. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home at Windsor Great Park, she says: ‘I think it’s one of the things that the Queen remembers with great happiness. Neither of them had ever done anything remotely similar, being let loose in a crowd like that to walk all the way from Buckingham Palace through to Trafalgar Square. ‘Everyone was kissing everybody and picking up hats and throwing them away. It was euphoria at its most euphoric!’. Mrs Rhodes, then young Margaret Elphinstone, was lodging at Buckingham Palace while working as a secretary for the military intelligence service MI6. She recalls how a small gang including 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, 15, and Mrs Rhodes’s brothers, left the Palace by the Privy Gate. ‘With the best will in the world, I can’t remember if Princess Elizabeth kissed anyone, but kisses were being thrown about very liberally,’ she says. ‘It was like we had all been living under a huge, heavy, dark cloud. And suddenly, it had gone. I’m so old now, I’m literally the only other person left alive who was there with them on VE Day.’. The Queen is said to remember the night with 'great happiness' In the film, which stars Canadian actress Sarah Gadon as the future Queen and British newcomer Bel Powley as Princess Margaret, the sisters are shown wearing cocktail dresses for their adventure. In real life, Princess Elizabeth was wearing her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform. Mrs Rhodes says: ‘In order not to be recognised, the Queen pulled her cap right down over her eyes and one of the officers who was with us said, “Look, I’m not going about with an officer who can’t wear her cap properly,” so she had to put it back. Mrs Rhodes adds: ‘I always thought it was very clever of the King and Queen Elizabeth [the Queen Mother] to let the girls go out into the night, with all those myriad of people around them. They knew it was something the Queen and Princess Margaret would never forget.’. Princess Elizabeth is also shown forming a brief attachment with a young serviceman called Jack, who takes her gambling and to a Soho brothel. ‘That didn’t happen,’ laughs Mrs Rhodes, whose younger self does not feature in the film. ‘Apparently, Princess Margaret escapes on the top deck of a bus. That never happened.’. Princess Margaret is also shown quite drunk. ‘No! There was no possibility. We never encountered anyone offering one a drink,’ insists Mrs Rhodes, the daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone. One of the true scenes in the film is of the Royal party dancing the conga through the Ritz. ‘The smart old ladies having drinks were gobsmacked,’ says Mrs Rhodes, although it actually happened on VJ night, August 15 – when Britain celebrated Japan’s surrender. The princesses were protected on their VE Day jaunt by Captain Harold Campbell RN, equerry to Princess Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. ‘He was deeply disapproving of the whole manoeuvre,’ says Mrs Rhodes. The party returned to the Palace after midnight. ‘It was emancipation,’ says Mrs Rhodes. ‘I don’t think anybody realises what she has had to give up. You give up your independence. Poor Princess Margaret is dead, but that night is something I know the Queen will never forget.’. ...And she recorded a secret song tape . Friends: Margaret Rhodes, left with Princess Margaret and Elizabeth, right. By Michael Powell. The Queen and Princess Margaret recorded a secret tape of children’s songs as a touching gift for their mother on her 90th birthday, it has been revealed. Pianist and composer Laurie Holloway has told for the first time how his friend Princess Margaret phoned him with the idea, days before the Queen Mother’s milestone birthday in August 1990. He was summoned to Buckingham Palace and taken to an upstairs room ‘where there was a dark brown, walnut grand piano and two microphones. There was also a sound engineer who I think they had got in from the BBC’. Mr Holloway said the Queen, then 64, and Princess Margaret, then 59, wanted to sing quite unusual children’s songs. ‘One was called I Know Where The Flies Go In Winter Time,’ he said. ‘The Queen said they were taught them by their mother’s father, the Earl of Strathmore. We rehearsed them a few times and then we recorded them in one take each.’. Mr Holloway, 77, musical director on Strictly Come Dancing for its first three series, said the Royal sisters sang ‘very well, beautifully in fact’ during the two-hour recording session. ‘The Queen has a nice, sweet tone to her voice,’ he added. He said Margaret told him the Queen Mother loved the gift. ‘She said that when they gave it to her at Windsor, the Queen Mother said she didn’t have anything to play it on, so they had to go out to the car to listen to it. ‘Later, Prince Charles arrived and wanted to listen to it. They told him he would have to go out to the car and to everyone else’s surprise he opened a cupboard and there was all the latest stereo equipment right there.’. Sadly, the cassette went missing after the Queen Mother’s death in 2002, although Mr Holloway wonders if a copy might still exist somewhere.  .","Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were let loose to join jubilant crowds.

CLIFF,cnndm,20aaaf9357b437f83ac7745f02b71d4e93d8753f,"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)The question haunting Kiev is this: Who might be murdering allies of Ukraine's ousted President Viktor Yanukovych? The idea that this might be happening is not entirely new. But it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high-profile shooting deaths in the Ukrainian capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to Yanukovych, the other of a Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views. Oleg Kalashnikov, the former member of parliament, was shot and killed shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday at the entrance to his apartment block. Kalashnikov, 52, was a member of the Party of Regions, the former ruling party in Ukraine, and was close to Yanukovych. Police are investigating the death as a murder. A day later, on Thursday, journalist Oles Buzyna, 45, was killed near his home by shots fired from a dark blue Ford Focus, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. The car's license plates were reported to have been from either Latvia or Belorussia. The killings renewed speculation, sparked by earlier unusual deaths, about a conspiracy to kill people close to Yanukovych. At least three former members of parliament with the Party of Regions have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks:. • On February 28, Mikhail Chechetov reportedly jumped from the window of his 17th-floor apartment in Kiev, having left a suicide note. He was suspected of having falsified the results of a parliamentary vote in early 2014 that essentially prohibited protest just as thousands of people were protesting against the Yanukovych government. • On March 9, Stanislav Melnik, a former member of parliament with the Party of Regions and the manager of several businesses in the separatist-minded eastern city of Donetsk, was found dead in his apartment near Kiev. He, too, reportedly left a suicide note. • And three days later, on March 12, Oleksandr Peklushenko, another former member of parliament, was found in his house in Zaporizhzhya, in southeastern Ukraine, dead of a gunshot wound. Police are investigating various scenarios, including suicide. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said Peklushenko ""might have wanted to avoid punishment for using violence against protesters, which he was suspected of."" Ukraine is deeply divided, and it has been for years. About a third of the population speaks Russian as opposed to Ukrainian. Whether the country should be drawn into the orbit of Russia or the West is a visceral issue, a question for many Ukrainians not of politics but of identity. Recent events have deepened the divide. In 2014, after Yanukovych turned his back on the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia, he was driven from office by mass demonstrations. And with Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea and its support for Russian-speaking separatists in eastern Ukraine, the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war. With a government toppled and armed conflict in the east, Ukrainians have reason to want each other dead. But the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly, according to which side of the country's divide one is on. The Opposition Bloc, the country's major opposition party, has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- ""bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists,"" the bloc's media office called them. ""It is clear oppression of those who are not afraid to criticize the government,"" it said. The government, unsurprisingly, sees things differently. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who came to office after Yanukovych was ousted, has demanded an investigation of the killings of Kalashnikov and Buzyna, his media office said. ""It is evident that these crimes have the same origin,"" the media office quoted Poroshenko as saying. ""Their nature and political sense are clear. It is a deliberate provocation that plays in favor of our enemies. It is aimed at destabilizing the internal political situation in Ukraine and discrediting the political choice of the Ukrainian people."" And Anton Geraschenko, an adviser to the country's interior minister, took the theory one step further. ""It should not be excluded that the killings of Oleg Kalashnikov and Olez Buzyna were planned and organized from Moscow and are a part of a plan to destabilize Ukraine and further support anti-Ukrainian mood in Russian society,"" Geraschenko said.","Oleg Kalashnikov, a former member of parliament with ties to ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, was shot and killed Wednesday.

The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final. Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final. 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted.

There, she was joined by boyfriend Dave Clark and viewed the action from a private box beside the country's Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. On her travels: Princess Beatrice pictured with David Lauren, son of Ralph, in Florence yesterday. Mingling: Beatrice with Suzy Menkes (left) and another fashionable guest at Palazzo Corsini.

Enraptured: Beatrice sat in the audience to watch a discussion between Ms Menkes and  Karl Lagerfeld. Styled up: Beatrice looked chic in a black leather jacket, a white shirt and an on-trend print shirt. She was also pictured enjoying a chat with another royal famed for his love of luxury living, Spain's big-spending former king Juan Carlos II. Unfortunately for Beatrice, her travelling days could be numbered with the Princess on the verge of relocating to the New York to take up a new job. The job, which is thought to be in finance, will be her first since leaving her internship at Sony following last November's cyber attacks. Since then, her life has been a round of parties and beaches, beginning with a trip to the Middle East to see the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix the same month. . Days later Beatrice and  Mr Clark, a Virgin Galactic executive, flew to Beijing, where they joined her mother Sarah Ferguson and sister Eugenie for the wedding of photographer and graphic designer Victoria Tang to Hong Kong lawyer Christopher Owen. Jet-set: The trip came days after she was seen watching the Bahrain Grand Prix with Juan Carlos II of Spain. And relax: Beatrice on a weekend away in Greece with friends last month. Chilling in the Caribbean: Beatrice during her trip to St. Barts in January. Next, Beatrice soaked up the sun with Mr Clark on two trips to Caribbean island St Barts, at one point staying on tycoon Lakshmi Mittal’s yacht. She also squeezed in three trips to her parents’ £13million chalet in Verbier, Switzerland. Last month she flew to New York to celebrate sister Eugenie’s 25th birthday during her third US jaunt this year alone.  .","Princess Beatrice is in Florence for the Condé Nast International Luxury Conference.

Redknapp left the team second from bottom of the table and they are now two points from safety under the leadership of Chris Ramsey.

Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by just 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year, it is claimed. It follows last year’s record price hike of 17.4 per cent in the capital. Economists said that the housing market had ‘got ahead of itself’ last year and would assume a much more leisurely pace in 2015. Scroll down for video . Forecasts show house prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace. File photo. Annual price growth across the country will then gradually accelerate again over the next five years, hitting 4 per cent by 2020. This year will be the first since 2009 that the UK as a whole out-performs London, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. This is because while prices in the capital stagnate, the housing market is still performing well in the East and South-East, and parts of the Midlands and North of England. But the CEBR said this victory for the provinces would be short-lived, since the London market will also recover in 2016. Prices there are set to rise by 2.7 per cent next year, above the national average of 2.3 per cent. London homes will also suffer no more price falls in the foreseeable future – and are forecast to see annual growth of an estimated 4.7 per cent by 2020. The predictions from economists at the think-tank were upgraded from their forecast in January, when they suggested average prices would fall this year. They said that radical changes to stamp duty had given the market a boost. In recent years many Britons had been deterred from moving home for fear of the punitive tax on house purchases. The tax was charged on the whole value of a property and successive governments had failed to increase thresholds, trapping growing numbers of families above a £125,000 threshold. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year. File photo. But, in December, the Coalition overhauled the system, replacing the unfair ‘slab’ structure with gradually increasing rates, which cut tax bills for the vast majority of movers. . Economist Scott Corfe, of the CEBR, said: ‘House price growth in the UK will rise much slower than last year – but it will still be positive. ‘The market got a bit ahead of itself last year, and at the end of 2014 it began slowing down and plateaued. ‘It has now started to pick up again outside London. We are still not building enough houses to keep pace with population growth so, as long as we have a shortage of supply, prices will keep rising. ‘House prices will continue to grow faster than inflation.’. It was a different story in London, however, where he said interest from overseas buyers had dwindled, pushing down prices. While the stamp duty changes meant lower bills for the majority, those buying million-pound homes have been hit by higher rates – deterring international investors and many wealthy Londoners. Mr Corfe said: ‘Stamp duty reform, as well as the depreciation of the euro against the pound – making London more expensive for European buyers – has affected prices in the capital. ‘Uncertainty around the general election and fears of a mansion tax [under Labour’s plans] may have also driven down demand since the start of the year.’ .  .","Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by just 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months.

A Japan Railway maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour (374 miles per hour) on an experimental track in Yamanashi Tuesday, setting a decisive new world record. A spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour, during which it covered 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles). That's nearly 20 football fields in the time it took you to read the last two sentences. Takeo Ookanda, who runs an exhibition center next to the test track, said witnesses erupted with excitement and applause when the new record was set. ""I was moved just like many other visitors here today,"" he told CNN. ""This maglev project... (increases) the hope that Japan can have a good growth again in the future."" The train broke its own record from last Thursday, when it ran at 590 kilometers per hour (366 miles per hour) on a test track. That beat the old record of 581 kilometers per hour (361 miles per hour), which was set in 2003 during another Japanese maglev test. Right now, China operates the world's fastest commercial maglev, which has hit 431 kilometers per hour (268 miles per hour) on a route through Shanghai. By contrast, the fastest train in the United States, Amtrak's Acela Express, is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour), though it usually plods along at half that speed. Unlike traditional trains, maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward. Japan's maglevs don't use metal tracks — instead, they float nearly 10 cm (4 inches) above special guideways, allowing for frictionless movement. Japan Railways has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between Tokyo and Nagoya, scheduled to begin service in 2027. That trip can take nearly 5 hours by car. But in the future, a maglev train could finish the journey in 40 minutes. READ MORE: The future of transportation will blow your hair back.

A teacher who fled the U.S. with his stepdaughter and her mother ten years ago has finally given himself up in Costa Rica. Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, gave surrendered at the U.S. embassy on Monday and were flown back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, where Kelley was arrested. The pair fled New Hampshire in 2004 along with Genevieve Kelley, Mary's mother, during a custody dispute with Mark Nunes, Genevieve's former husband and Mary's father. Genevieve, now 50, handed herself in last November, but refused to give up the location of her husband and daughter, who had not been seen for a decade until this week. Speaking to People magazine, Scott Kelley said: 'It was time to come home.' He is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due to face in court next month. Kelley's case dates back to December 2004 when Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness. However, Genevieve, also a physician, refused to hand the girl over, instead taking her to Colorado for a second opinion, where a doctor diagnosed her with acute post traumatic stress disorder. While in Colorado, Genevieve alleged that Mr Nunes had sexually abused the girl, and then fled to South America along with current husband Scott. The state Division of Children, Youth and Families investigated and said any claims of abuse were 'unfounded,' and instead concluded that Genevieve instead likely abused the girl. Charges were never brought, however, because by that point the Kelleys, along with Mary Nunes, had already vanished. Mary Nunes, disappeared when she was aged 8 (left), and is now aged 19 (digitally aged version, right). The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004. Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decade. Despite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year. Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward. Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding. But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe. Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home. Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed. Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hiding. Scott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custody. Mr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. . 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.' Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said. It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. . Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors. Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin. .","Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, fled U.S. in 2004.

The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: ""It was a joke, and no offense was meant."" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: ""We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real."" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised ""money back if he walks"" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius.

The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‘I’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,’ said the South African legend. ‘When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986. Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009. Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters. ‘Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.’. It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‘bulking up’ too much in the gym. ‘I’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don’t watch what they eat,’ he says. ‘Just because they’re lazy, they can’t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National. ‘I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn’t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‘I’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‘Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That’s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it’s so wrong.’ Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‘I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,’ he said. ‘I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I’d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‘I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role.

Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?’. Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. ‘There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,’ said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf’s Mount Rushmore.",Rory McIlroy is favourite to win the Masters at Augusta National this week.

Headteacher Linda Shute has banned children from consuming drinks - including tea, coffee, fruit juice and soft drinks - in a bid to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School in New Addington, south London. But some parents believe the water-only rule is too strict, claiming many children go all day without a drink because they do not like water. Scroll down for video . A headteacher is forcing primary school pupils to only drink water during the school day after banning all other drinks, including fruit juice. Samantha Moore, who launched the petition, said: 'As a mother, I have the right to choose what my son drinks.' Another campaigner, Anela, from Croydon, added: 'They should be able to drink whatever they want and not just water because some kids don't like water.' . Mrs Shute, who announced her aims by enforcing the rule in a school newsletter last month, said: 'The water-only policy is being very well supported by parents and children. 'Thank you for this and know in your hearts, if you have any doubts, this policy is for the long-term health of all your children.' But her move provoked a backlash from some, who branded it a 'joke'. Alan Fay said: 'It's about time that schools started looking after the kids again and stop just doing what is told by the powers above.' Gemma Irwin, from New Addington, added : 'I believe that it should be up to the parent what their child drinks. 'If teachers are allowed tea and coffee, why can't a child have a bottle of juice or flavoured water?' . But the school has defended its decision. The rule has been enforced to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School (pictured) in New Addington, south London. It follows a similar ban which sparked anger at Valence Primary School in Dagenham, east London, when it was introduced in January last year. Headteacher Elizabeth Chaplin brought in the new rule as part of a 'health drive' and drinks other than water were poured down the sink. In June last year, children at Carlton Central Infants' School in Nottingham, were barred from drinking fruit squash - a measure opposed by some parents. Tam Fry, chairman of the Child Growth Foundation and spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, is among campaigners who have pushed for healthy drink options in schools. He has praised schools that clamp down on sugar-filled juices, which he believes should be limited to one small glass a week. Mr Fry said: 'Fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar, and it needs to be a treat - not an everyday occurrence. The preference in schools should be water, which is hugely beneficial.'  .","Headteacher at Rowdown Primary School in New Addington, south London, has banned all other drinks, including tea, coffee and fruit juice.

A 39-year-old woman named Lillian Roldan came forward to author John Glatt to say she dated Castro from 2000 to 2003, a three-year period during which Castro kidnapped and imprisoned Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry in his Ohio home. Roldan describes Castro in Glatt's book The Lost Girls as nothing short of a gentleman, who was 'completely normal' in the bedroom, and even romantic. Scroll down for video .

She says she visited his house often and never knew about the young women he was keeping prisoner. However, she says he did keep his basement padlocked, which she found peculiar. When she asked about the need to lock the door, Castro allegedly told Roldan that he kept his money stored down there and 'didn't want his kids to steal it'. . In the book set to be published later this month, Roldan recalls meeting 16-years-older Castro on a blind date set up by friends in May 2000. He allegedly invited her to watch him play music one night and it was 'love at first sight'.

As for their sex life, Roldan says Castro was 'completely normal' and 'considerate'. . She says at one point during their relationship, Castro popped the question but Roldan declined since she didn't believe in marriage. .

They branded the problem ‘irritating’, ‘annoying’ and ‘frustrating’ and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. . Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system.  . But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. . It was raised by the BBC’s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: ‘Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? . 'All because you can’t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?’. Another added: ‘I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.’. Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes.

Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC’s Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem.

He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. ""He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,"" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a ""guerilla satirist."" The New York Times dubbed him the ""Che Guevara of advertising,"" and years later, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. ""Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,"" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. ""RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend."" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. ""Wun'erful Wun'erful,"" his 1957 spoof of ""champagne music"" — on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May — lampooned ""The Lawrence Welk Show."" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit ""Cry,"" which Freberg rendered as ""Try."" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including ""St. George and the Dragonet,"" a 1953 send-up of the series ""Dragnet."" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, ""That's Rich."" Three years later, he presented ""The Stan Freberg Show"" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: ""Mad Men's"" return. He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for ""The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows."" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy ""Time for Beany,"" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an ""office"" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show ""Toast of the Town."" Hollywood Reporter: ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" -- the untold story. Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as ""Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,"" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in ""Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was ""More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,"" and he even had a corporate motto: ""Ars Gratia Pecuniae"" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon ""What's Brewin', Bruin,"" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's ""Three Little Bops."" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, ""Back in Action"" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear. Survivors also include his wife, Hunter, and a granddaughter. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.

It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. . Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point. The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley. He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well.

Morgan Fox’s cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. . It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge.

CLIFF,cnndm,13ae16f71b19eca4673c71cccaa51f0813e21bae,"Starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little-known British company to avoid paying taxes across Europe. The U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills. It could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal. For the first time yesterday, details emerged about the UK company at the heart of the probe, which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch government. Probe: Starbucks ran its European division - including the UK - through the Netherlands, but it paid just £1.9million in tax to the Dutch government, from a reported £300million profit. Starbucks ran its European business, including its booming UK division, through the Netherlands where it paid almost no tax on its profits. But it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct British entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the Dutch taxman. By registering its Intellectual Property – such as its brand and logo – in a UK company called Alki LP, it was able to pay hefty sums from its Netherlands division into Britain. Its Dutch division paid just £1.9million of tax, despite reporting profits of £300million – a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the UK entity, including a claim that it had not a single registered employee. Starbucks has already been called ‘immoral’ by MPs for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the UK. Schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in Switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark-up to the Netherlands, where they are then roasted before being sold on again to Britain. This means that much of the money it makes from UK sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes. Revealed: It is now claimed the company, which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices, may have used a British company to put hefty sums from its Netherlands branch into the UK. Between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in Britain, despite racking up combined sales of more than £3billion here. But after its tactics were exposed, the company offered to pay a voluntary £20million in tax to avoid a public boycott. Now details of a little-known tax division have emerged. A UK-registered holding business called Alki LP was set up to house the branding of the business. In a bizarre move, Alki appeared to have no employees – and was registered at the offices of Starbuck’s tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie. Compliance: A Starbucks spokesman said the company complies 'with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines' But because of the very limited details available, it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received – or whether it paid any tax in the UK. Accounts for Starbucks’ Dutch businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division. But without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the UK division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven. The business, which was closed down last year, has never filed proper accounts at Companies House. When it was dissolved, Alki was folded into a new company, Starbucks EMEA Holdings – though this business has also yet to file any accounts. This is an aspect that EU investigators believe is key to their probe. Earlier this year the British boss of Starbucks provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax for years. UK managing director Mark Fox said the company needed to get ‘its mojo back’ before it would begin to turn a profit. But he was confounded only weeks later when Starbucks reported its first ever UK profit of £1.1million – despite sales being a bumper £300million. On this it paid taxes of just £232,363, as well as the sum of £11.2million as part of its voluntary £20million tax payment. A Starbucks spokesman said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we continue to cooperate with the European Commission’s state aid investigation in the Netherlands.’ .  .","U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission.

The Belgium striker was signed by Liverpool in a £10million deal after impressing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, before being loaned back to Lille for the 2014-15 season. But Origi has been following Liverpool's progress from across the English Channel and after seeing the rise of Ibe and Raheem Sterling, is eagerly anticipating working under Brendan Rodgers. Divock Origi said the progress of Liverpool's youngsters have heightened his excitement at joining the club . Origi referenced the progress of winger Jordon Ibe (left) as an example of youth players improving at the club. Origi added that he thinks the long-term progress of Raheem Sterling means he is joining the right club. 'When you see how the coach and the staff work with the young players - how Sterling, for example, has learned over the years and how Ibe is now integrating with the team, it is very interesting,' Origi told Liverpool's official website. 'It is very nice to have seen that this season. 'The manager is one of the reasons I came to Liverpool - he's someone who has proven he knows how to work with young players, knows how to develop young players and also lets them play.' Origi, who has scored seven times in Ligue 1 this season, believes that the backing of Liverpool's supporters will help him elevate his game. 'I'm somebody who when I feel loved, when I feel appreciated by the supporters, then I can give even more. It gives you a boost on the field. In Belgium it was this way, and I can see it at Liverpool.' Origi (second eight) earned a transfer to Liverpool after impressing for Belgium at the 2014 World Cup. Origi added that the challenges he has faced at Lille this season will make him a better player for Liverpool. Origi admits it has been a challenging season at Lille attempting balance the demands of the league with the Europa League but believes the experience he has gained means he will arrive at Liverpool a better player than this time last year.

Residents of Beckley Club Estates in Dallas, Texas, say that they saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday. Footage from the home of Lisa Solis shows the thief grab the animal by both its claws before shoving him in his black SUV around 7pm. Residents of a Dallas neighborhood saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday. The man is seen bending down and picking up the bird by its claws before shoving it into his black Chevy Tahoe with its feathers sticking out of the door. Solis's neighbor Tisha Crear said she saw the event, and rushed out of the house and yelled at the man, but could only watch as he drove off with half of the peacock's feathers hanging out of the door. Ms Crear said that she had heard peahens screaming before the incident when the bird, the largest and oldest male peacock of those that live in the subdivision, was stolen, according to NBC Dallas. Ms Solid called the theft and aggressive treatment of the bird animal cruelty. . 'Do I need to sit on the porch with a shotgun or what do I have to do? Because we are going to protect the peacocks,' Ms Crear said, holding a feather from the stolen bird. Residents of the neighborhood, where peacocks have lived for the past 20 years, filed a report to the police about the missing animal.

The haul of produce was even enough to keep some growers self-sufficient. But now the gardeners are at war with their council after they were moved to new allotments so their old prize-winning plots can be bulldozed to make way for a car park and five-a-side football pitches. Scroll down for video . Living the Good Life: Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years. But the Broadway Allotment Association member says soil at the group's new site is 'dreadful' Thriving: The association's allotments were moved by Oldham council. The old prize-winning site (pictured) has been bulldozed to make way for a car park and football pitches. Pay out: But gardeners have complained about their new site, saying it has bad drainage and poor soil. The association has called on the council to pay growers compensation for the problems they've experienced. Many are complaining that the soil in their new allotments is so poor they cannot grow a bean - and that the new plots' drainage is so bad that their seedlings are rotting in the ground. They are demanding that Oldham council pays out compensation for the problems - which have seriously curtailed their growing season. Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years and he and his wife, Margaret, 78, live the Good Life as they are largely self-sufficient. He said: ‘The soil is dreadful and the land is flooded. It is impossible to grow there so the allotments are not fit for purpose and need plenty of work. ‘I still have potatoes, leeks, parsnips, cabbage, broccoli, strawberries, raspberries and gooseberries in storage from last year’s crop but this year I’ ll be lucky to grow anything. 'Dreadful': Gardeners say the soil at their new site (pictured) is so poor they can't grow a bean. Oldham council moved the group from their old allotments, which had been popular with residents since the 1930s. The drainage (pictured left) is also so bad that the seedlings of allotment holders are rotting in the ground. They are demanding the council pays out compensation for the problems at the plots in Failsworth, Oldham. ‘My wife and I totally depend on the crop from my allotment each year as we have three freezers to store it and it keeps us going all year.’. Mr Fyson, who has two grandchildren and one great grandson, has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. He said: ‘I’ve done quite well over the year. But this year is going to be dreadful. I’ve been digging some trenches to drain the land and have had to bail out with a bucket. We won’t be able to grow anything of any quality here for quite a while.’.

Much-loved: One allotment holder, Michael Fyson, 77, has grown fruit and vegetables at the old site (pictured) for more than ten years. He has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. The plots managed by the Broadway Allotment Association in Failsworth, Oldham have been popular with residents since the 1930s and kept many fed during the Second World War. However growers have been moved to land a few hundred yards away as part of a plan to redevelop the nearby Lancaster Club off Broadway into a ‘garden suburb’. The development will include 144 homes, with the Grade II-listed club turned into apartments and a five-a-side football pitch and car park will be built on the former allotments. Oldham council developed the new site and constructed greenhouses and sheds for the growers in recompense for losing their original plots. Ian Wade, 55, association secretary, said: ‘I understand the need to redevelop the area and it would be okay if they had given us a plot that worked. ‘But the soil they have put down is ridiculous. It has powdered brick, rubble, sand and stones in it and it is impossible to grow anything in it. ‘Gardeners can work to improve the soil but it is so shocking nothing will grow for years. The site is also flooded and seems impossible to drain.’. Now, the 17 tenants are calling on the council to give them compensation for the delay they will face in growing their produce and the extra work in making the land fit.

However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces. Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different. Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' . Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA. One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments. Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests. Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. . Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. . Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. . Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.'  . Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.'   . Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment. One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited. If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write. Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.'  . Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. . How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter. Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests. Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag. Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous. .

Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. . Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian. He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. . Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts. Toure has more than two years left on his current £220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy — although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. . City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao. Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

Some are charging up to a ‘shameful’ £2,700 for one eye – treble what it costs the health service – raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of £6,000 each. . Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. . Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery themselves. The operation usually costs the NHS between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: ‘It’s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. Scroll down for video . ‘We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.’. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. ‘It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. ‘Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.’. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.’. In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation costs the NHS about between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. More than half of over-65s suffer from cataracts, which are cloudy patches in the lens that make vision blurred or misty. Sight can be restored in a simple 45-minute operation, with doctors using ultrasound waves to break up the cataract. . Most hospitals charge patients between £700 and £1,000 per eye for cataract treatment and say the money is spent on improving services. But this rises to £2,552 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and £2,700 at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent. Several trusts actively encourage patients to ‘self-fund’. The University Hospital Southampton’s website informs patients that ‘surgery will be offered much sooner than the usual NHS wait’. It adds: ‘Our cataract choice service offers a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS, bringing private healthcare within the reach of many more people.’. Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset says its private cataract service will ‘help you get back to the things you love’. Patients at North Cumbria are offered free parking and a daily newspaper, while at Frimley Park they can choose from an ‘exclusive a la carte menu’, which includes whitebait and chicken goujons.","Some hospitals are charging up to a ‘ shameful ’ £ 2,700 for one eye.

In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in ""The Jinx,"" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of ""lying in wait"" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she ""was a witness to a crime."" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. ""At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,"" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is ""mildly autistic"" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism.","Robert Durst, 71, is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.

CLIFF,cnndm,76193914c933ac43f8dec059708881a25dd6df9b,"Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. . But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto. The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' . Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' . High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! . 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.  .","Pep Guardiola split his pants during Bayern Munich's 6 - 1 win over Porto. The Spanish tactician wore a tight - fitting grey suit by Tom Ford.

My day could have been ruined but, because of this guy, it was the highlight of my day.' The note reads, in part:. I noticed you left your lights on. The battery will probably not have enough charge to start your vehicle. I left a blue extension cord on the fence and a battery charger beside the fence in the cardboard box.

'Sure enough,' Derek recalled to the National Post, 'I looked over at the house my car was parked beside, and there was a blue extension cord plugged into an outlet behind the guy’s house with a battery charger right there beside it.' Derek was able to get his car started, but when he rang the good Samaritan's doorbell, there was no answer. So, Derek left his own note as a thank you for the kind gesture. .

Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote. But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014.

CLIFF,cnndm,17c80ce62c082281957473d3e7b53e4c88a6203d,"It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .",Barcelona beat Paris Saint - Germain 3 - 1 to reach the Champions League semi - finals.

CLIFF,cnndm,39816732fdc433c5d126feed54f8bb12867bb4e5,"The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April–11 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay. You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century. The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey – around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels – another military-medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery – a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle. The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

CLIFF,cnndm,476469ad322b867bebce7523324d060e97092a30,"I don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, ""This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,"" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's ""on television,"" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those ""golden rule"" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said ""some insulting and regrettable things,"" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should ""always choose to be respectful and take the high road."" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. ""I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,"" wrote ""Cait"" on Twitter. Said ""Shannon,"" also on Twittter, ""I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be."" ""Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,"" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to ""treat other people the way you would want them to treat you"" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable. So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. ""That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,"" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a ""slut."" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. ""Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,"" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. ""... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more."" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her ""pre-recorded track"" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, ""Do you know who I am?"" and ""You're about to find out who I am."" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. ""We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,"" she said on ""Good Morning America."" ""It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that."" And, she added, ""When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,"" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect?

Up next, Rockhold wants a title shot and a shot at MMA history in New York. Rockhold capped a brief and brilliant appearance in the cage with a rear naked choke at 2:32 of the second round and made Lyoto Machida tap to win a main event showdown between two of the top middleweights in UFC on Saturday night. Luke Rockhold beat Lyoto Machida by second-round submission in New Jersey. Rockhold celebrates his victory and now wants a shot at the middleweight title . 'I am the No 1 contender,' Rockhold said. 'I'm the best guy around.' Rockhold should be next in line for a pay-per-view title shot in the 185-pound division. With a dominant win over the 36-year-old Machida, he positioned himself to take on the winner of the UFC 187 fight next month between Chris Weidman and Vitor Belfort. Machida never put up much of a fight in his brief stint in the cage. Rockhold lost on his UFC debut in 2013, then rebounded with wins over Costas Philippou, Tim Boetsch, Michael Bisping. He won his third straight fight via submission and looked at his best at the Prudential Center. 'I did my part,' Rockhold said. 'Weidman, you're going to do your part. Let's take this across the way. Madison Square Garden, let's make history.' Rockhold was dominant from the first bell as he cruised to victory against Machida. Machida was marked up badly after the first round and didn't last long in the second session. MMA would have to become legalized in New York for that bout to happen. The Senate again approved a bill to legalize and regulate the combat sport that includes boxing, judo, wrestling and kickboxing. UFC remained hopeful that the assembly will finally approve the bill that would allow the promotion to stage a dream card in December at MSG. 'If it doesn't happen, it'll be crazy,' UFC President Dana White said. Jacare Souza, the No 1 ranked middleweight, made short work of Chris Camozzi in the co-main event.

Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double. Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday. Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox. Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle. The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert.

Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards.

CLIFF,cnndm,ec35ca922f2f717d417c685c3b5f5c7f64ca4867,"Mad Men star Jon Hamm's secret college bullying shame has been exposed by court documents unearthed from the actor's time at the University of Texas at Austin. According to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by Star magazine, the 44-year-old Golden Globe winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong. The documents claim that Hamm, 44, was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic November 1990 initiation, but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom. Scroll down for video . College student: Jon Hamm is pictured here in the University of Texas at Austin yearbook for 1990 (left) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the Sigma Nu fraternity. The actor is pictured (right) this week. According to the explosive court documents, Hamm was in his sophomore year at UT-Austin when a prospective 21-year-old pledge was called to the Sigma Nu house at 2.30am. When he got there, according to Travis County Court documents, Hamm - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him, 'It's going to be a long night!' The unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. The alleged victim told police that Hamm and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear, 'pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion', causing 'great pain'. The pledged then claimed that Hamm led him to a basement 'Pit' where he slammed the junior's face into the ground while he was doing push-ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight. Shockingly, after this, Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, but instead made him blow them out. Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21-year-old pledge and beat him with a paddle. At the end of the vicious hazing ritual, the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the 'Party Room' where Hamm 'hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room'. Allegedly not content with this, Hamm then went onto to break into another potential pledge's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation. However, the morning after, the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him 'hiding in a closet at his apartment, his buttocks and legs black with brusises.' Despit pleading with his mother not to go public, saying 'They'll come kill me!', she reported the incident to the police. High school senior: These pictures of Jon Hamm are from 1989, the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin. Early career:  Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Huge hit: Man Men and the character of Don Draper has given Jon Hamm his biggest role to date - winning a Golden Globe for his work on the AMC series. Eight warrants were issued for Hamm and seven other frat members, which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident. Three members of Sigma Nu were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and Hamm was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991. In the wake of the hazing incident, the Sigma Nu fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge's mother made her son's alleged assault public by going to the police. . In 1990, the AP reported that Sigma NU would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were 'physically and psychologically attacked'. The-then national president of Sigma Nu, James Cherry, said that he was revoking the charter of its UT-Austin, saying, 'Basically, we're out of business on this campus'. 'But our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today.' A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Hazing incident: Following the alleged assault of the 21-year-old pledge, the Sigma Nu fraternity at UT-Austin (pictured) was shut down . Recently, the Mad Men star has admitted that playing the complex role of Don Draper has taken its toll. In an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days, Hamm opened up about the effect that playing Madison Avenue ad man Don Draper had on his psyche. The 44-year-old star told Variety: 'Playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties, it’s not fun to live in this guy’s headspace year after year.' He added: 'People ask, ""What’s the difference between you and Don?"" Look, I drink, I get drunk. I’m not immune to that,. 'And (creator) Matt (Weiner) will tell you, the darkness in Don has not abated, it’s gotten worse year after year. It’s relentless. And it can be hard on you as a person. I love coming to work; I love the people I work with. But it’s been rough.' As he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark, brooding, alcoholic womanizing character, Jon revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona.","Jon Hamm, 44, was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the University of Texas at Austin's Sigma Nu fraternity in 1990.

The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James’s Palace, saying: ‘We are going to do something new this evening. ‘The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it’s her 25th birthday today.’. Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: ‘You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).’. He then turned to the lance corporal and added: ‘If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...’ There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones. . Eugenie looked delighted and said she was ‘very proud, Pops’ of her father’s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries.

The Duke of York holds an iPad as he invites the audience at the Pitch@Palace event to sing happy birthday via FaceTime to his daughter Princess Eugenie. Sarah added: ‘We think you all need to go for choir practice.’ Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. ‘Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,’ he said.

CLIFF,cnndm,6a2920354a3ea03c429458605513aa812980ba15,"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League's Easter weekend fixtures and the race for promotion across the Football League. 1. Playing Jordan Henderson as a wing back instead of in his normal central midfield position was an idea that went spectacularly wrong for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. . The England star, who has taken over the captain’s armband in the absence of Steven Gerrard, gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes as he struggled to handle the role at Arsenal. . Jordan Henderson (left) toiled as a wing back in Liverpool's defeat against Arsenal and lost the ball 23 times. Henderson, usually a central midfielder, has not given the ball away as much all season for Liverpool. There hasn’t been a single one of his previous 29 Premier League appearances this season in which he’s lost possession more. 2. John O’Shea has clearly learned the canny defender’s art of letting his brain do all the running. The theory is if you get in the right position in the first place, you don’t have to chase to recover. In 90 minutes of helping Sunderland keep a clean sheet against Newcastle, the Ireland international logged just 11.9 metres at sprint speed on the EA Sports performance data. It clearly works for him – he’ll be 34 at the end of this month but remains the sole Premier League outfield player to have appeared in every minute of every game in all competitions for his club this season. . John O'Shea only sprinted 11.9 metres during his impressive display in Sunderland's 1-0 win over Newcastle. O'Shea (third left) celebrated Sunderland's win with Costel Pantilimon when the final whistle was blown. For good measure he’s also completed the full 90 minutes of all five European Championship qualifiers for the Republic. 3. Steven Caulker’s form has suffered from playing with too many different partners at QPR but there are signs the former Spurs and Cardiff centre half is returning to his best. . The 23-year-old was a towering figure as a West Brom side led by the powerful figure of substitute Victor Anichebe fought to recover from being three goals down at half-time. . Steven Caulker (right) wins a header against West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye. Caulker made 20 clearances – as many as the rest of the Rangers back four put together – and more than any other Premier League defender all weekend. 4. Chelsea need have few fears if Diego Costa’s hamstring problems mean they have to rely on Loic Remy for goals in the last eight games of the season. . The France international’s tap-in from Eden Hazard’s pass for the winner against Stoke was his fifth Premier League goal of the season from just 456 minutes on the pitch. Loic Remy (centre) scored Chelsea's winner in their 2-1 victory over Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Remy could be vital to Chelsea as they look to win the Premier League title after Diego Costa went off injured. That’s a goal every 91 minutes – actually a better ratio than Costa whose 19 Premier League goals have come at the rate of one every 103 minutes. 5. Burnley boss Sean Dyche has talked about stability all season and continues to practise what he preaches. . He picked an unchanged side for the 16th time this season for the home clash with Tottenham and was rewarded with a valuable point. . Sean Dyche selected an unchanged side for the 16th time as Burnley drew 0-0 with Tottenham on Sunday. That’s more than double the number of times any other club has kept the same starting XI – next highest is Leicester with seven. 6. Kasper Schmeichel looked to have lost his first-team place at Leicester a few weeks ago following the arrival from Chelsea of veteran Mark Schwarzer. . But the 28-year-old son of Manchester United legend Peter returned for the 4-3 defeat at Tottenham just before the international break, and justified Nigel Pearson’s decision to keep him in the side with a brilliant display in the 2-1 win over West Ham. . Kasper Schmeichel made a string of outstanding stops as Leicester beat West Ham 2-1. Schmeichel made six saves as well as several vital catches – the only time he has made more saves in a game this season was the eight at Chelsea back in August that stopped a 2-0 defeat becoming a rout. 7. Swansea boss Garry Monk shared the club’s rise from football’s basement to the Premier League as a player, and isn’t afraid to back his belief there are more in League Two with the potential to play at the top. . He put his club’s money where his mouth is by signing Matt Grimes from Exeter for £1.75million in January, and has now given the 19-year-old his debut in the top flight. . Matt Grimes (right) impressed in his substitute appearance for Swansea in the 3-1 win against Hull . It wasn’t a bad little cameo, either. Swansea scored their third in the 3-1 win over Hull barely a minute after Grimes came on. 8. Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer left striker Jordan Rhodes out of his starting side for the 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final at Liverpool – but surely can’t drop him again for Wednesday’s replay. . The 25-year-old Scotland international is in the best scoring form of even his prolific career after netting the second of the 3-0 win at Leeds. It was his eighth goal in the last 12 games for Blackburn and took his total for the season to 17 from 35 Championship starts. Jordan Rhodes (right) scores Blackburn's second goal against Leeds in the Championship on Saturday. 9. Boyhood Hearts fan Jason Holt admitted he was upset at missing out on the celebrations when his old club clinched top spot in the Scottish Championship a few weeks ago. . But the midfielder who moved to Sheffield United in January might yet be able to open some bubbly with his new club after scoring in the 2-0 derby win at Barnsley. . It was the 22-year-old's third in as many games and gave Nigel Clough’s side a seven-point cushion for a place in the League One play-off zone. Midfielder Jason Holt (left) is proving important to Sheffield United's hopes of going up a division. John Akinde celebrates scoring for Barnet, where he has found the net 30 times in the league this season. 10. John Akinde has a peculiar place in the football history books for being the first player sold by an internet vote of fans – he was a promising teenager at Ebbsfleet in 2008 when the online poll decided to let him move to Bristol City. . The striker’s move never worked out – but seven years and nine clubs later he’s setting records again and this time for much better reasons. . His finish against Nuneaton that took Barnet back to the top of the Vanarama Conference was his 30th League goal of the season, equalling Gary Bull’s club record set in 1991. .  .",Jordan Henderson gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes against Arsenal.

CLIFF,cnndm,f7e0de384a8e52cafaa3161f71a979d269fe12fe,"The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but ""inadvertently"" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. ""It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used,"" Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an ""excusable homicide."" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. ""We're holding up all right at this point,"" Andre Harris said. ""We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation."" How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. ""However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO,"" the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies.

Struck again: Christian Englander, 30, has thrown a banana peel at a black man for the second time in one week. He was arrested on Monday for hurling one at Dave Chappelle. On Thursday he struck again at a bar. Not amused: Santa Fe police say a man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a show in New Mexico Monday, hitting in the comedian in the leg.

According to Englander, his first attack came after Chappelle mocked his friend's name 'Johnny Appleseed'. . Police said the 30-year-old, from Santa Fe, appeared to be drunk as he sat near the stage. . According to TMZ, Englander thought Chappelle's quips were racist, so he decided to throw the peel, which he had in his pocket. .

Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. . 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. . Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected. Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. . Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60.  .","Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois.

Ahead of the trip to the Kassam Stadium, Wasps' hunt for an automatic European Rugby Champions Cup spot next season had stuttered after winning just one of their previous five fixtures in all competitions. However, they claimed a 40-13 win over Welsh with tries from Varndell, Ashley Johnson, Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua. Tom Varndell crosses for one of his three tries as Wasps ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium. It was far from plain sailing for Wasps, though as the Exiles, whose defeat to Bath last time out confirmed that they will finish bottom of the table, trailed 12-5 at half-time after Opeti Fonua bundled over after the first two of Varndell's tries. But Johnson dotted down and Varndell added his third before Tagicakibau secured the bonus point for Wasps, with Alapati Leiua getting in on the act with the last play of the game. Chris Elder scored Welsh's second try of the match in the second period. Wasps got off to a fast start at the Kassam as they went 12 points clear after as many minutes. The visitors found the tryline after only four minutes as Varndell broke down the right flank and scored in the corner, veteran fly-half Andy Goode converting well from a tight angle.

Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. .

Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott. Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. .

'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right.

The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. . Scroll down for video . A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs. Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. . A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_. While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland.  . The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. . 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.'

CLIFF,cnndm,8012ab9261e117ab47a2759b3c0b628f2a007a82,"According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, ""(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia."" The Columbia team concluded that ""The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking."" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, ""We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students."" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that ""the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent."" ""Actionable"" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers ""true."" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were ""of or concerning"" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is ""concerning"" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about ""a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue."" If I said, ""The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals"" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the ""small group"" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are ""between jobs,"" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.","Rolling Stone's article about alleged gang rape at University of Virginia drew criticism.

One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas. Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’. Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday. Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off. Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’.",Jordon Ibe is set to sign a new long - term deal at Liverpool.

Tickets go on sale on May 27 and the match is sure to sell out quickly with the likely capacity of the one court used being around 7,000, as it is for the AEGON Championships, which takes place two weeks before Wimbledon. The All England Club’s overworked show courts, plus the redevelopment work being done there, meant that SW19 was never an option only five days after the Championships finish. The fixture means a bumper helping of six weeks’ top level grass court tennis in the UK this summer, a far cry from 20 years ago when some believed the sport’s one organic surface might even disappear. This time there will be three weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon, so by the time GB take on France for a place in the World Group semi-finals all the players will be perfectly attuned to the grass. The court at Queen’s is at least the equal of Wimbledon in terms of quality, and the atmosphere will be very different from the usually staid one that accompanies the principle warm-up event for the big fortnight. Thanks to Murray, GB and France look well-matched and it could well depend on who wins the doubles rubber on the Saturday. France has seven players in the world’s singles top 50, although some have been affected by injuries this season. However, they will be encouraged by the recent comeback of Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who is their best grass court exponent and looking in decent form after overcoming arm problems.

Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland, the representative of her husband's estate, is suing Bassel Saad, along with another man who controlled the team and the soccer league. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland (pictured left with her late husband) has filed a $51 million lawsuit against Bassel Saad (right) who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. Bieniewicz died after Saad punched him in the head just moments before Saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in Livonia. Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other, and performed CPR which failed to work. . 'We hope this lawsuit sends a message that when you commit uncivilized acts in a civilized world there are consequences, even beyond the criminal realm,' said attorney James Acho, who had known Bieniewicz since childhood. Cyril Hall, Saad's attorney in the criminal case, said Friday that the lawsuit surprises him. 'Bassel Saad is not an individual of wealth. He was a mechanic,' Hall said. Behind bars: Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from a telephone listing for the soccer league. Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. . He expressed remorse in court and said he prays for the Bieniewicz family. The lawsuit also names the Michigan United Soccer League, which is accused of allowing Saad to play despite his reputation as a violent player. Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad. 'I speak for his dozens of buddies, many of whom go back to our days at Catholic Central High, and we want justice for his family,' said Acho, who is handling the case with co-counsel Karen Daley. . In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded no contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation. Mrs Bieniewicz testified at Michigan's Capitol earlier this year in support of proposed legislation that would make it a felony to assault a sports official in the state. Referees ‘are out there on an island with no one to defend them,' she said. 'Something more than a misdemeanor should be in place.' .

A James Forrest strike and Stefan Johansen’s penalty were enough to see off a spirited challenge by the bottom side as Celtic moved eight points clear of Aberdeen. But although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win, Deila felt their cause wasn’t helped by the state of the Paisley surface. And he believes Scottish football will struggle to develop top players if there isn’t a drastic improvement in our pitches. Celtic manager Ronny Deila was impressed with his side's performance against St Mirren on Friday night. ‘It was a tough game, St Mirren were well organised and played very deep,’ he said. ‘They fought really hard and it was difficult to break them down. We had to be patient. The pitch was better than some others we’ve played on. But the pitches in Scotland are terrible. ‘If you want to develop players and get passing football, it’s difficult when the ball is bouncing all the time. It’s much easier for the other teams to just sit behind the ball and try to break down our play. ‘It’s better to play on an artificial surface than this. If they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality, it’s totally different and much closer to European standards. James Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren. ‘If we are going to develop good young players, you need a good surface to play and train on. If not, you get fighters. If you want skills and technique, play on better surfaces. ‘They are much better in Norway. Sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they don’t train there and there aren’t other teams playing on them. And we play in the summer. That’s the biggest thing. The pitch here might not look so bad but try to play on it.’. TV pictures showed Leigh Griffiths eating a chocolate biscuit while sitting on the bench. But Deila, a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning, laughed it off. ‘I think it was a carbo biscuit which is totally different! I’ll have to check his weight tomorrow.’. Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory. Goalscorer Johansen believes there’s no stopping Celtic as they close in on a treble. ‘It looks great for us now,’ he said. ‘I don’t think we’re unbeatable but there is a huge confidence in the team. ‘We are starting to look fitter and have much more of the ball because we’re playing with a higher tempo. That’s the way the manager wants us to play. I said in the beginning when people were asking questions I was confident he would be a great and it’s starting to look that way.’. Saints boss Gary Teale felt there were positives in defeat but wasn’t happy about the handball awarded against Viktor Genev for Celtic’s penalty. ‘Was it ball to hand or hand to ball?

In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire ""homegrown"" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.",Al Qaeda confirms that two of its leaders were killed in CIA drone strikes in January.

CLIFF,cnndm,b8803c87ad83ffc194b4161bfcdd6e9584e7d653,"Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for ""lost"" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the ""holiday"" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the ""mistake"" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut. Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the ""war on women"" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious ""war on women"" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The ""war on women"" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the ""war on women"" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative ""solution"" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.","Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups.

Chris Lewis, 68, has brought the unusual court case against 48-year-old former wife Nicola over the child he helped raise as his own for 17 years. In court documents he claims Mrs Lewis had sex with another man only a few months into their marriage, but did not tell him. She had a child – Charlie, now 19 – as a result but led him to believe the boy was his, he argues. Suing ex-wife: Chris Lewis, 68 (left) has accused his former partner Nicola, 48 (right) of duping him about the paternity of her son Charlie. DNA tests now prove that Charlie is not his biological son, he says, and as a result of the deception he suffered loss and damages – and wants compensation totalling £322,400. The claim, made in documents before the High Court in London, says that the pair married in October 1994 and that Mrs Lewis gave birth to Charlie in March 1996. The couple separated in May 1999. Although Charlie subsequently lived with his mother, Mr Lewis says he ‘would see him regularly and make financial contributions towards his maintenance and advancement’. He claims that his ex-wife continued to lead him to believe that he was the boy’s biological father and he was recorded as such on the birth certificate. He was discussed as being the father in the course of the couple’s divorce, with Mrs Lewis signing ‘statements of truth maintaining that was the case’. Everything changed in April 2013, however, shortly after Charlie’s 17th birthday, when both he and Mr Lewis had DNA tests. They are said to have proven beyond doubt that Mr Lewis was not the boy’s father. The court documents claim that Mrs Lewis’s repeated assertions that her ex-husband was the father of her child ‘were made fraudulently’ with her ‘knowing them to be false or not caring whether they were true or false’. Mr Lewis’s lawyers say that Mrs Lewis ‘had sexual intercourse with David Alderson or an unknown person which resulted in the conception of Charlie in or around May or June 1995’. High-profile contract: Mr Lewis's company, Chris Lewis Media, provided coverage of the Equestrian events at the London Olympics and the TV producer brought Charlie to the venue during the games. They add: ‘On no occasion during the parties’ marriage did Mrs Lewis inform Mr Lewis that she had had sexual intercourse with another person/persons. ‘She knew that Mr Lewis was not the biological father of Charlie, or was reckless as to whether he was the biological father, or did not believe he was the biological father. ‘By reason of her deceit and misrepresentations, Mr Lewis has suffered loss and damage, and claims damages plus interest.’. Mr Lewis was for decades one of the BBC’s leading sports producers, masterminding footage of every Olympic Games since 1972 as well as working on coverage of ten football World Cups. Since leaving the BBC in 2006, he has specialised in equestrian sports. He is understood to have taken Charlie to equestrian events at the London 2012 Olympics, which his TV company Chris Lewis Media was filming, a few months before he discovered he was not the boy’s father. Speaking about the court case, Mr Lewis, of Twickenham, South West London, said: ‘It’s been a very hurtful time for all parties.’. Mrs Lewis lives in a £1.2million house in Shepperton, Surrey, and is a company director of a fireplace shop. She told the Daily Mail last night: ‘I haven’t even looked at the document from court, and I can’t say anything because it’s in the hands of my solicitors.’.

The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'. But the Prime Minister hailed today as 'money-back Monday' - with a raft of tax changes coming into force putting more cash in voters' wallets. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls, speaking in Leeds this morning, ramped up his attack on the Tories today - claiming that David Cameron was planning a VAT increase and cuts to the top rate of tax. Mr Cameron has claimed that Labour are planning to increase taxes by £3,028 on 'every working family'. . But, speaking in Leeds this morning, Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke hit back with an accusation that Labour has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. . They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'  Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Mr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires. 'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and £1,100 a year worse-off? 'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards? 'How can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the Tories are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five?' Mr Balls said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning £1 million a year £340,000 over the course of the next Parliament, while someone with income of £5 million would get a total tax cut of £1.94 million over the five-year period. Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut £10 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children £1,440 over four years. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg meets supporters at the Grove Pub while out campaigning in Surbiton, London. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said. However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than £3,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago. Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.' Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over £150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes. Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost £400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to £12,500. . By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just £37 to taxpayers. 'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West. 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate. Labour has already failed to commit the £8 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.' Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton. Mr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... 'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament. 'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal. On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition. Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News. 'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.' Mr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'","Shadow chancellor claims' millions paying more while millionaires pay less' But PM hails today as' money - back Monday' with raft of tax changes coming into force.

She said that despite Leo almost burning down the  house the family still love him, but he will be locked out of their new kitchen.  A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: 'We're naturally extremely pleased that no one was injured in this fire and while unusual, it's not unheard of for our crews to deal with incidents like this.

CLIFF,cnndm,d6f0e9927121675b465ceac42d73d6c90b1015fe,"It's T20 season on the sub-continent and the world's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the Indian Premier League, cricket's most exciting and richest domestic tournament. Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title. CHENNAI SUPER KINGS. The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final. £1,740,000 - Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. . 3325 - runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119 - wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60 - matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8 - teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 -  English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS. The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. . They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team. KINGS XI PUNJAB. After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title. KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS. The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League. MUMBAI INDIANS. The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood. After losing in the eliminator against Chennai last year, the Mumbai Indians will once again expect to reach the play-offs and mount a serious challenge for the title. ONE TO WATCH: The demon bowler that is MALINGA has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the IPL and was key in their success in 2013. He will once again lead this bowling attack. .

RAJASTHAN ROYALS. Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan. Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals. ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE. Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (£1.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack. ONE TO WATCH: Any of their big three batsmen really, but DE VILLIERS is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots.  . Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle pictured playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2012 tournament. South African AB de Villiers is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket. SUNRISERS HYDERABAD. The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL. Kevin Pietersen, here playing for Delhi in 2012, will join Hyderabad if they make the play-offs.  .",The 2015 Indian Premier League begins on April 8 and ends on May 24.

Witnesses say a fight broke out on a rubber dinghy carrying more than 100 African migrants from Libya to Sicily, after which the men were thrown to their deaths. A group of 15 men have now been arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate,' Palermo police said in a statement. Murders: A fight over religion broke out on a boat carrying 105 migrants from Libya, after which 12 men 'professing the Christian faith' were thrown to their deaths. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centers after disembarking from in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily. Italian police say they were informed of the alleged attacks by a group of Nigerian and Ghanaian survivors upon their arrival in Palermo, Sicily yesterday. The survivors said they had boarded a rubber boat on the Libyan coast on April 14, which had 105 passengers aboard. During the crossing, a fight broke out over religion, with the group of Muslim passengers threatening the Nigerians and Ghanaians after the latter declared themselves to be Christians. 'The threats then materialised and 12 people, all Nigerian and Ghanaian, are believed to have drowned in the Mediterranean,' the police statement added.  . The 15 migrants arrested over the attack on their arrival in Palermo are from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau.

This week, Italian coastguards intercepted more than 42 boats attempting to make the crossing to Europe. The police statement said their motive for the attack was that the victims 'professed the Christian faith while the aggressors were Muslim.' This followed reports earlier today of a shipwreck feared to have cost 41 lives off the Italian coast. Four men, two Nigerians, a Ghanaian and one from Niger, who had been rescued while floating in the Mediterranean by an Italian Navy helicopter reported the shipwreck once they arrived in the Italian port of Trapani today. . They said had left Tripoli in Libya on Saturday and stayed adrift for four days. The new tragedies come just days after aid agencies reported 400 presumed dead in the sinking of another ship near the Libyan coast. . The deaths have raised calls for a more robust search and rescue of the seas between Libya and Europe amid a surge in migration between the Middle East and Africa toward Italy.","Fight broke out on boat carrying 105 African migrants from Libya to Sicily.

But they were left disappointed after pumping the liquid to the surface, only to discover it was so polluted that they could set it on fire. Residents of Ansai, in Shaanxi Province, central China, said they could smell gas and petrol coming from the well, and blame a leak from a local petrol station, The People's Daily Online reports. Villagers in Ansai, Shaanxi Province, in central China, dug a 46m well in order to get fresh drinking water, but when the pumped it to the surface the found it was so polluted it could be set on fire. Local officials say they have now launched an investigation into how the water from the well, which cost £1,000 to build, became so polluted. Locals said they could smell  petrol when the water surfaced, and blame the pollution on a leak from a local gas petrol station, a claim which the owner denies. However, when Chinese officials investigated, they said they could find no trace of a spillage, leading some people to theorise that the villagers could have struck oil. However this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits only occur between 750 and 4,500m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. Tuo Zhijun, a villager in Ansai, said: 'Who knew when we turned on the pump, once the water was seeping through, everyone could smell gas and see oil slick.' Some locals have suggested that the lucky villager may have struck oil, but this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits typically occur between 750 and 4,5000m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. After drawing the first fresh water out of their new well, the villagers discovered they were able to set it on fire because it was so polluted. Local officials do not yet know exactly what substance is in the water, though they say they are conducting a specific investigation to discover the cause. ‘We suspect that there was an oil leak from a petrol station not far from here.’ . However, Li Jianhua, the manager of the petrol station, refuted these claims, saying: ‘The authorities have already examined the place and nothing was wrong. . 'There has not been any problems with the well in the petrol station either.' Local government officials in Ansai say they have already started a specific investigation. .

The 30-year-old's success has enabled him to meet stars in other sports as well as showbiz celebrities and key political figures.

But Judy Murray has already wasted no time in revealing she simply ‘can’t wait to be a granny’. However, the tennis coach, who helped propel Andy, 27, and his brother, Jamie, 29, to sporting success, has a couple of caveats – he has to get the French Open and Wimbledon out of the way first. Mrs Murray, 55, who has carved out her own star status after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing last year, also said she would be a ‘very active granny’ and in the same way she coached her sons, she already has plans to introduce her grandchildren to tennis. She told Closer magazine: ‘I’m really looking forward to being a granny. I’ve always wanted to have grandchildren but I had to be patient and let them get married first. ‘I’m not sure when they will have kids as Andy has the French Open followed by Wimbledon, but I know he wants them.

In the episode she apologizes to the women, most of whom forgive her and say they would have been her friend in other circumstances. 'I'm sorry that I dragged you guys into my mess. Whether you believe me or not, that's up to you,' she said to the women. The women has spoken to the women for various amounts of time, ranging from a month to more than a year. . Kayla had taken the identity of a man named Keagan, who goes to school in Montana. He apologized to the women who all had been talking to a Kayla, who used Keagan's pictures online.

It emerged that Kayla was a catfish - someone who tricks others online by setting up fake profiles with fake pictures and names- after one of the women became suspicious and looked into the man she had been talking to. Kayla told Dr Phil that she 'didn't have any evil intentions' and that she was just trying to figure herself out. 'I created an online persona so I could figure out who I was, and figure out if I was gay or not and figure out if I wanted to be part of the religion or not.' Kayla, who now says she is gay, said. She added: 'Do I want to be part of the church, or do I want to be gay? And unfortunately, I saw myself in a position where I couldn't have both... You don't understand how difficult that is.'

The women appeared uncomfortable at times during the interview and some even rolled their eyes at what Kayla was saying. Most of the women, however, agreed to forgive Kayla for what she did. She told Fox13 that they would regularly text and talk and he even sent her flowers on Valentine's Day - but that Anderson would never agree to meet up. At the same time, another victim, Sara Vanwagenen, believed she was in a relationship with a man called 'Hyrum Young'. She too reported that the person they were in contact with would never agree to meet up. The pair eventually realised the texts they were receiving were from the same number and it turned out they had both been duped by a woman called Kayla, from Texas. . Vanwagenen is reported as saying: 'I let this person into my life in a really big way. I was really angry and really hurt.' Hayes added: 'She just knew everything about me it was just really hurtful to find out that you literally didn't know anything about this person, not even something so foundational as their name.' .

Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February. Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state – let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. . 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah – especially with his ties to the royal family.'

The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University.

When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege.

Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his ‘manifestly ill-founded’ case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. . This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the £40,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: ‘This is a shocking example of Labour’s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.’. Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. . He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius’s claim that extradition breached his human rights was ‘inadmissible’. They added: ‘The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.’ .","Kestutis Martuzevicius, 52, is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania.

""We want someone who can speak for the royal family,"" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. ""We welcome it, we are ready for it,"" he said. ""We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary."" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. ""A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people"". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. ""We had an agreement with the crown prince,"" he said. ""The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue."" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was ""hopeful"" that he would ""do more than his predecessor"", Hillary Clinton. ""US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more."" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. ""If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. ""It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. ""So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy."" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for ""peaceful demonstrations"", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. ""It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government."" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. ""These people have a lot of followers in the street.

Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society.

Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday.

CLIFF,xsum,19311364,"Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. ""Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. ""That seems fairer to me,"" he added. The think tank also said the move would be ""extremely popular"" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be ""cleansed"" of ""hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices"". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced ""radical reforms"" to ""get Britain building"" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme ""set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes"". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure ""social housing goes to those in greatest need"", he added.","Councils in England should consider selling off some of their social housing stock, David Cameron's spokesman has said.

CLIFF,xsum,13599161,"Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months. It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. ""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. ""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. ""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site. ""Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said.

CLIFF,xsum,36404868,"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

""There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,"" he says. ""The chat room is like the foyer of a church."" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. ""We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,"" says Mr Parker. ""The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity."" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. ""Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,"" he says. ""The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. ""It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world."" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. ""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. ""The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago."" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being ""too religious"". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. ""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal. ""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. ""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga."" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. ""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. ""The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly."" ""Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,"" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. ""He was a great communicator.""

""Retribution will catch up with the true instigators, wherever and whoever they are,"" their resolution said. Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for ""reprisals against journalists"". ""We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,"" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. ""All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,"" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them ""lies"". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that ""retribution"" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April. ""There will be retribution!"" he told the Russian news website RBC. ""Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics."" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. ""We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,"" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses.

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"". Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. ""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made."" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low."" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"". He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for ""rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing"".","One of London's biggest letting agents has received more than £ 2m in housing benefit, the BBC has learned.",Pegasus,test,correct,

CLIFF,xsum,40883148,"The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: ""I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves."" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. ""Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,"" said Bennett. ""To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine."" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: ""I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands."" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a ""litany of information"" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were ""several reasons to approve the fight"". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. ""I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,"" said Bennett. ""He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. ""Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. ""Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. ""That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight."" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: ""He's good to go."" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an ""out of control"" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi.

CLIFF,xsum,36882573,"Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,"" he says. ""The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards."" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. ""Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. ""But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. ""When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. ""Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. ""The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. ""At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. ""I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. ""He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'"" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the ""Stab in the Back"" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline. ""As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,"" says Mr Smith.

CLIFF,xsum,34802406,"It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""","Poorer children in Scotland are more likely to be involved in crime, according to a new study.",Pegasus,test,correct,

Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and ""fingerprinting"" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named ""Dynamic Mongoose"", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a ""key vulnerability"". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be ""exceptionally worried"" that it is seen as a ""soft touch"", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",Nato's biggest ever anti-submarine exercise is under way off the coast of Britain.,Pegasus,test,correct,
CLIFF,xsum,38328811,"United Nations officials rarely use the words ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing,"" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. ""They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,"" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. ""They don't want us,"" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. ""These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them."" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.""We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,"" he said. ""It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed."" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. ""This has been unrelenting since July,"" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. ""The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides."" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. ""War, war, war,"" she began, ""who are you and where do you come from?""

CLIFF,xsum,30453069,"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

""I'm disappointed not to be playing,"" said Westwood. ""I can understand him picking a mate and he has picked a very good player. It is probably more to do with the rules than anything."" The Tour Championship is the final event of the Race to Dubai, with four players still in with a chance of topping the European Tour Order of Merit. Henrik Stenson, holder of a course-record 25 under at the Earth Course, leads but Willett can leapfrog the Swede should he win the tournament. Willett would also top the list if he finishes second and neither Stenson nor Alex Noren win in Dubai. Noren, another Swede, needs to finish at least second and hope Stenson and Willett finish down the field. McIlroy has an outside chance which requires several permutations falling into place - including Stenson finishing no higher than 46th in the 60-man field. It took McIlroy 14 holes to register his first birdie of the day, and although he swiftly added another on the next, the four-time major winner double-bogeyed the 16th after needing two attempts - the second minus his right shoe and sock - to play from the edge of a water hazard.

CLIFF,xsum,37680168,"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35.

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""

He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights. The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law. Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros. Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months. Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: ""No. Why should we? ""These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues."" The minister added that ""my Polish colleague"" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary. EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously. Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports. Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law.

CLIFF,xsum,33960105,"They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. ""There's a huge market for our timber.

CLIFF,xsum,37204235,"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270.

Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

Concerns over the future of some of the 5,000 workers at the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency centre were raised in October after Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement. The chancellor announced that the tax disc would be replaced with an electronic system in October 2014. The new system will allow people to pay the charge by monthly direct debit. Mr Hedges had written to Mr Hammond asking for clarification of the government's intentions. In his response to Mr Hedges, Mr Hammond said: ""It is likely that the introduction of a direct debit scheme may mean there will be a natural reduction in the amount of refunds received, in addition to the withdrawal of the tax disc. ""This may mean changes to job roles and the need to train on new processes. ""Any reductions in numbers of people needed for these activities will be managed through redeploying to other growth areas of the business."" Mr Hedges welcomed the minister's assurances. He added: ""Whilst disappointed that the changes will reduce the number of job opportunities at the DVLA, I can see the advantages of both paying by monthly direct debits and not having to show a tax disc.

From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months.

For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days. In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.

I know I have been fortunate,"" said the 24-year-old. ""Football can be about being in the right place at the right time, and I have been lucky. ""Maybe in a couple of years I will look back and realise how mad it has all been."" Washington  combined representing non-League St Ives between 2010 and 2012 with a job delivering mail. Having averaged more than a goal-a-game in his 50 appearances for a club in the ninth tier, he then got his break with Newport who paid £5,000 for him. The Welsh club were promoted to the Football League in his first season, although Washington barely featured. He then moved to Peterborough in 2014 and by mid-January of this year, when QPR took him from London Road, Washington had scored 15 goals and aroused the interest of Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill. Washington had only been to the country once before his international bow against Wales in March but he qualified through the grandparent rule.

CLIFF,xsum,33675471,"The scheme, developed by the OU, has been designed to observe students' paths through courses and engagement with online learning modules. The OU's Prof John Domingue told the BBC: ""This has been developed as a tool for tutors to help students. ""We are planning to use this data for students studying in 2015-16."" The programme, called OU Analyse, was developed at the university during the 2013-14 academic year. It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms. The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening. Prof Domingue added: ""We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable. ""Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling. ""The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided."" The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data. Ruth Tudor, president of the Open University's Students' Association, thinks the scheme is a positive one. ""It's a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help,"" she told the BBC. ""I would like to think that this would improve the drop-out rate from OU courses. You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage. ""That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful."" Reports suggest that some other British universities are thinking of using similar methods and Ms Tudor added: ""I don't see why this shouldn't happen in other universities. It has happened in the USA and I'm surprised they're not using it here.""",The Open University (OU) is planning to use data analytics to identify students who may be struggling with their studies.,Pegasus,val,correct,
CLIFF,xsum,33811105,"A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no ""magic bullet"" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.

CLIFF,cnndm,fe4531d4b8d7ea109e62bb89c055a5a2d844f524,"Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates. Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season. 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. . And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations.  . 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. . Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres. Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time. But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again. 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. .

CLIFF,cnndm,122337044e34f279f3bfac270816b52e4d323af1,"Ronald Koeman is looking forward to this weekend's 'special' match against Tottenham, ahead of which the Southampton manager praised the 'great job' predecessor Mauricio Pochettino did at St Mary's. The former Argentina defender ended a 16-month stint on the south coast last summer to sign a five-year deal at White Hart Lane. Pochettino's exit was the catalyst to an unparalleled talent drain from St Mary's, although successor Koeman has not only steered the club to calmer waters but to new heights. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has praised the work of his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino at the club.

Koeman had to cope with several player sales at Southampton, including Luke Shaw to Manchester United . Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana (right) was also sold to Liverpool shortly after Koeman arrived at the club. With five matches remaining, Saints are just a point and a place worse off than Spurs in sixth and can usurp them in the European spots with victory in Saturday's early kick-off. 'Everybody was afraid because we had to make a lot of changes in the team,' Koeman told reporters. 'But I think the quality of the players that we brought in were good, at a good level. I think the rest of the players had really a good aspiration and ambition to do a good season, to play a good season at a good level. 'Now we are fighting for a high position in the table. There's still five games to play and a very nice one this Saturday afternoon. 'It is Tottenham, the difference is only one point and, okay, for the fans maybe it makes it a little bit more special because Mauricio is now the coach and was the coach of Southampton. 'He is the coach of the opponent this Saturday, so that makes it special but the game will be decided between the white lines.' Koeman was speaking at St Mary's after meeting Barclays Spirit of the Game hero Tina Croucher, who was being rewarded for her community work at the club. The Southampton manager and midfielder Victor Wanyama answered questions from a handful of supporters as part of the event, where talk of Pochettino was rarely far away. Koeman says his return along with the potential implications of the result makes Saturday's match the biggest at St Mary's since he took the reins. A positive result would see Saints break their record Premier League points haul set last year by Pochettino, although he is unlikely to get a particularly warm reception. The former Argentina defender's departure left a sour taste with many Southampton fans, whose travelling support gave him a taster of what to expect at White Hart Lane earlier in the season. 'Sometimes if you go as a Barcelona player to Madrid the reception is difficult, and sometimes in Holland,' Koeman said, when asked if he has such a bad reception. 'But, okay, I think the reception for Mauricio normally has to be good because he did a great job for Southampton. 'I like him as a person and as a coach and we have a good contact.' Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama (centre) shields the ball from Swansea players back in September. There certainly does not appear any bad blood between Koeman and Pochettino, despite the latter suggesting earlier in the year that he handed the Dutchman an easy job at Southampton. Koeman took those comments in his stride, joking at the time that he only came to Southampton 'to have a nice little holiday'. Now, just days before the game, the Saints boss gave a more serious answer, praising his Spurs counterpart for the legacy he left at St Mary's. 'I think they make the beginning (of this) and developed the quality of the players, the young players,' Koeman said. 'I think the structure and organisation in the team, the spirit of the players starts under Mauricio. 'I took that over and maybe we were different in some details. From what I heard, maybe I try to do more training sessions with the ball and maybe he was a little bit more physical. 'I think the start, for the development of the team, was under Mauricio and he did a great job last season. 'We continue (that) and so far we made it a little bit better than it was, but that is all about the experience and quality of the players.' .

'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money.

'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.'

'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on.

CLIFF,cnndm,675550549d4f9d3722445d6b5da24b9fac62a52f,"Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. ""Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too."" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. ""Everyday Americans need a champion,"" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, ""and I want to be that champion."" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.

Taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point. And Fernandes, currently in Malaysia, spoke of his experience of a variety of emotions while watching the game from the other side of the world. 'It's a strange thing thus QPR love,' he tweeted. 'I went to bed at 1 in the morning. I got up exactly at 2.45 am. No alarm. My heart knew it's QPR time. . 'I watched the game on my iPhone all kinds of emotions.

The character of QPR's Clint Hill and Chris Ramsey were praised by their club's chairman on Twitter. Charlie Austin looked like he might have scored a late winner for QPR but Christian Benteke equalised. Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey. 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals.

Gerrard will leave Anfield at the end of the season to join Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy and the skipper is hoping to bow out in style by leading Brendan Rodgers' side to the final at Wembley. But ahead of Wednesday night's quarter-final replay with Blackburn, Fowler has warned Gerrard's team-mates not to concentrate on providing the 34-year-old with a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career. . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) trains alongside Rickie Lambert at Melwood on Monday. Gerrard will miss Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final replay with Blackburn because of suspension. Reds legend Robbie Fowler, pictured with Kenny Dalglish, says Liverpool's players must not focus on Gerrard. Fowler told goal.com: 'Everyone would absolutely love Steven to win it, what with this being his last season and possibly last game, and hopefully that will be the case. 'But Liverpool have got to get themselves into the position where they can't do this just for Steven Gerrard. They've got to do it for every individual involved with the club. That's the way it should be.' Gerrard will miss the trip to Ewood Park as he serves the second match of a three-game suspension and Fowler hopes that Jordan Henderson and Co put their missing captain to the back of their minds. 'If you put too much effort in for one man, maybe you can get a little bit too excited or overboard,' added Fowler. 'As much as it would be Steven's last game, they've got to get past that and just do it for themselves. 'In an ideal world, they'll do it, and no-one would love it more than me. Steven deserves to go out on a high but they've got to do it for themselves. It's not all about Steven.' Fowler has also urged Raheem Sterling to end his contract wrangle and commit his future to the club after he rejected a new deal worth £100,000-a-week. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has rejected a new £100,000-a-week deal to stay at Anfield. Fowler believes Sterling, pictured training on Monday, should stay at Liverpool to develop his game. Writing in his column for the Daily Mirror, Fowler said: 'I think it’s nonsense to suggest Sterling will have to go elsewhere to win trophies and fulfil all these dreams he’s apparently got. 'In the space of two seasons, with a very, very young team that will only get better, they should have won the league, should have beaten Chelsea in a semi to get to Wembley... and should play in an FA Cup Final there in May. 'I was brought up at Anfield and still work there, so what else am I going to think?, but he’d be crazy to go at this stage in his development, especially because he’s being guided by a special manager who has already turned Luis Suarez into one of the best players in the world... and earned Luis the money to go with that status.'  .",Liverpool face Blackburn in the FA Cup quarter - final replay on Wednesday.

When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross. Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season. If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right. .  .

Defender Clint Hill was the unexpected scorer of QPR's equaliser just after half-time to make it 2-2. Hill grabs the Queens Park Rangers badge in celebration after scoring his first ever Premier League goal. Charlie Austin got ahead of Ron Vlaar and had looked as if he'd won the game for QPR. At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. . The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. . Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points .

Villa Park looked a picture on Tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head-to-head in Birmingham . Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal – his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post.

CLIFF,cnndm,5a3d3b7a4ae2c36d206bfc289e43b8ec6cec1223,"It's all Pep Guardiola's fault; him and the good folk of Scotland or, at least, St Andrews. It is a simplification, of course, but perhaps a useful way of understanding why, as we survey the Champions League quarter finals, there are no Premier League clubs troubling the scorers. Bayern Munich take on Porto on Wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben among others you might anticipate a sixth Champions League semi-final for Guardiola in his six years of management. Of course Guardiola isn't alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe; nor is it really down to St Andrews, though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs. Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto. The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday. Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn't that the Barcelona team changed. Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them. What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews, where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola. There Messi was a distracted individual, sometimes sneering at Guardiola's insistence on organisation and pressing, according to Guillem Balague's account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola. But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics. The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing, sidling up to him after training, putting his arm round him to assure him of his support. Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi-final in his six years as a manager. Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics. Messi, the precocious star, suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola. And, as a result, he began to buy into Guardiola's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football, which was already a template at Barcelona. For tiki taka is not what made Guardiola’s team great. 'I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's rubbish and has no purpose.' It sounds like Sam Allardyce, but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by Marti Perarnau in his book Pep Confidential. What Guardiola added to Barcelona’s game was the intensity, drive and sheer energy which had wilted under Rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession. Sometimes, when assessing the English problem in Europe, it helps to reverse the question. So, rather than ask 'Why are we so bad now?' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005-2009?' Guardiola led Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011 (pictured) The former Barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success. For Chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph, that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of English clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier, bucking the established trend. Between 2005-2009 the Premier League provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the Champions League; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24. Even asking that question is revealing as what English clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy. Only Liverpool and Manchester United actually achieved that in the five-year period of English ascendancy, though, of course, Chelsea did so improbably in 2012. What was different about English clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the Premier League. Jose Mourinho may never have won the trophy with Chelsea but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win. Rafael Benitez was an extraordinary force, the Diego Simeone of that era, regularly out-witting Mourinho and taking a relatively normal Liverpool team to two finals. Guus Hiddink engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of Mourinho. Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 when English clubs were dominating the latter stages. Chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds. Rising to the challenge of Mourinho and Benitez, Sir Alex Ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period, playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before Guardiola and others made it fashionable. English teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope. What they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous. Benitez, Mourinho, Hiddink provided that and Ferguson responded. Put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which, allied to the commercial success of the Premier League, was pushing players and teams to new heights. The Premier League’s TV money of course brought in good, technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success. The money is bigger now and those players still come but it hasn't helped Manchester City. At the zenith of the Premier League's dominance, the 2008 Moscow final, ten English players started the game. Manchester City were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of Barcelona. Chelsea exited at the same stage as England have no representatives in the quarter-finals. When Jurgen Klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in Germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich - he explicitly referenced the Premier League and its pace. He recognised that continental Europe had fallen behind. It was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the English game which helped the Premier League dominate Europe. Conversely, it was Guardiola - and others, such as Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the Premier League. Clubs such as Barca, Bayern, Dortmund have retained their technical superiority over English clubs but they are now likely to out-run them and out-press them. In reality there is no one man responsible for that change. And, Guardiola's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for South American football and especially Marcelo Bielsa, rather than the Premier League. But when that change took place, the Premier League lost its competitive edge. And when Guardiola put his arm around Messi at St Andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game, European football changed forever.","Bayern Munich take on Porto in the Champions League quarter finals.

Hart was unable to keep out goals by United's Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling. Manchester City are four points behind rivals United . The 27-year-old has even given up on knocking Arsenal out of second place. 'It's essential to try and finish third,' he added. 'We've got to get our heads down and win these massive games.' City had looked dominant in the early stages, racing into a 1-0 lead that they could have extended before Ashley Young's equaliser triggered a derby demolition. 'Not many teams have put us to the sword like that,' Hart said. 'United know what they are doing, they took their chances. Hart, pictured saluting the travelling City fans, does not understand why his side are struggling for form. 'It's hard to take. We've won enough of them to know how to lose properly though and we weren't good enough after the first 15 minutes.' Hart added that City had let their fans down and revealed he was at a loss to explain a dramatic loss in form since the turn of the year that has seen them take 18 points from a possible 39. 'It would be easier to win games if I knew what was wrong with us but we've played well and been unfortunate in some games,' he said. 'I'm hurting from this defeat. There's a lot of emotion running through me. Let's see how it feels on Monday, we'll think about it and we'll go again.'  .",Manchester City were beaten 4 - 2 by rivals Manchester United on Sunday.

CLIFF,cnndm,83f68aeae05b5f3ce73c40794dcc06fe6399e2c9,"Ashley Young is desperate to avoid being part of the first United team to lose five successive Manchester derbies. United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years. Last November's 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium was the fourth successive derby win for City. The last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago. Ashley Young (right) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours Manchester City. Ander Herrera celebrates scoring as United move above City for the first time this season. United have lost the last four derbies to City:. 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City. 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United. 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City. 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United. United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games. Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014. 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning. Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country. I was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad, but I have just got to make sure I am playing well here at United and hopefully I will get the call at some time soon.'  .",Manchester City have won the last four Manchester derbies.

Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award.

It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.’ Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis’ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon’s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. ‘That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. ‘We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch.

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.’ Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. . If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three. .

CLIFF,cnndm,83d6436741b1022766c9baa31ffc00748fa415ec,"On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled ""Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,"" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal ""what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,"" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans ""targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction."" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book ""Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,"" notes, ""the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems."" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? ""Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!"" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. ""This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it."" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.","In Baltimore unrest, NPR reported tension between African - Americans and Asian - owned businesses.

To be fair, however, this probably wasn’t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls. The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks. Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. .

For the next 48 hours, however, the pint will have to stay behind the bar as Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood go toe to toe in the scrap for survival. As far as QPR manager Ramsey is concerned, Sherwood’s Aston Villa are in no danger of tumbling out of the Barclays Premier League, despite their lowly position. . The verdict is delivered on the evidence that Ramsey has gathered in four years of working alongside Sherwood at Tottenham. Chris Ramsey believes his friend and neighbour Tim Sherwood will keep Aston Villa in the Premier League. But the QPR boss will be pulling no punches when he clashes with his former Tottenham colleague on Tuesday. QPR scored four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since March 1994 v Norwich (4-3). . ‘Without a shadow of a doubt I think he will keep them up,’ said Ramsey. ‘He has a good squad, players who have the wow factor and he knows how to manipulate those particular players. . 'If I was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do, I would be putting a bet on him keeping them up.’. Ramsey will be doing his utmost to extend Villa’s top-flight uncertainty on Tuesday night and has reason for optimism given Rangers’ stunning victory at West Bromwich Albion. . Ramsey says if he 'was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do,' he would bet on Villa staying up. QPR celebrate the second of their four goals against West Brom from Charle Austin (right) A second win in the Birmingham area in four days would send QPR above Villa on goal difference. Sherwood and Ramsey, a duo operating as boss and assistant last season at Spurs, will share words in advance. ‘Me, him and Les (Ferdinand) live probably 10 minutes from each other so sometimes there is a pint to be had. I’m sure we’ll speak before the game,’ added Ramsey. ‘We worked together at Tottenham for four years in various jobs,’ said Ramsey. ‘It’s great you can have two coaches who’ve gone through the system and are coaching in the Premier League. The game has to look at it from an English point of view. ‘If things hadn’t gone our way against West Brom then the mountain looks a little bit bigger. The game will be very important for both teams.’. Ramsey and Sherwood were in the trenches together at Spurs and live within 10 minutes of each other. The perspective for Ramsey’s team is more positive after putting four past a West Brom side who for the first half looked to have beach on the brain already. . Joey Barton scored in added time at the Hawthorns to underline the emphatic victory, having six minutes earlier received a forearm in the face from Youssouf Mulumbu that saw the Albion midfielder sent off. That ended any chance of a comeback for the hosts, who trailed 3-0 at the break but pulled one back through Victor Anichebe.

Eduardo Vargas celebrates the opener for QPR in the remarkable 4-1 win over West Brom on Saturday. Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob to give his side a 3-0 half-time lead.

Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him – but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur’s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea’s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas’ late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances – as many as the rest of Chelsea’s back four put together – and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger’s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal’s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over – one more than they’d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany’s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January – a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them – a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom’s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion’s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football’s black and white days – every one of Albion’s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow – and captain Darren Fletcher’s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It’s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total – Christian Benteke’s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman’s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn’t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue – Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals’ youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months – just in time to be available for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke’s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One – it’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe’s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who’ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani – and he’s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places.

CLIFF,cnndm,1361753fc103b8ae702610de85d5e7476eef5fd6,"Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time. It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe. The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. Reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties.

The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him. Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved.

Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106. When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’. Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’. Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled. . Sanchez leaps skywards to celebrate his second goal of the game for Arsenal against Reading. Sanchez (left) rifles Arsenal into the lead against Reading in the FA Cup semi-final against Reading.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time. Federici’s mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. . Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored. But Reading goalkeeper Federici made a splendid one-handed save to tip the ball up and against the crossbar. Sanchez (centre) earlier took the ball past goalkeeper  Federici (second left) before losing his footing and falling. Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal. It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici.

CLIFF,cnndm,681f725e8a8da7598c8bbdee420a8be17228513e,"Barcelona will offer £50million for in-demand Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, and plan to let him stay in Italy for a year on loan. Spanish press reports indicate Chelsea are their only rivals for the Frenchman's signature. Pogba is one of Europe's most in demand young talents but Spanish paper SPORT say that the leaders in La Liga and the Barclays Premier League are the only two viable destinations for the 22-year-old Frenchman. With Barcelona currently under the restrictions of a FIFA-imposed transfer ban until the January window, Pogba would have to be loaned back to Juve until the 2016-17 season as part of any prospective deal. . SPORT say Barcelona will make a £50m offer for Paul Pogba while Marca look at the race for La Liga. Pogba is said to be the subject of a £50m bid from Barca with Chelsea their only realistic transfer rivals. Lionel Messi returned to training for Barcelona after a foot problem ahead of facing Celta Vigo. SPORT claim that Pogba has listened to Barca's offer but is yet to decide on his future with four years remaining on his contract with the Italian champions. The Catalan daily also say that Lionel Messi has recovered from a problem with swelling on his foot to start for Barca in their return to La Liga against Celta Vigo on Sunday after making it through a training session unscathed. Also in Spain, Marca look at Real Madrid's quest to overhaul their perennial rivals at the top of La Liga. They say that if Real win their final 10 games to take a total points haul of 94, they can count on winning the title. That might be easier said than done, however. No team has won their last 10 games in La Liga in the last decade, no matter how sure Real are that Barca will falter. L'Equipe look ahead to a big weekend in the French title race, A Bola pin Benfica's hopes on Nicolas Gaitan. David Luiz and PSG have made their way to the top of Ligue 1 but that position will be challenge this weekend. Marseille and their star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac will want to knock PSG off the top of the table. It's a huge weekend in France with Le Classique top of the bill, Lyon getting the opportunity to top the table and Monaco taking on St Etienne. With that in mind, L'Equipe go with the headline: 'The hunt is on'. Champions PSG are still in with a shout of an unprecedented treble, sitting top of Ligue 1 with eight games to go, in the semi-finals of the French Cup and having reached the last eight of the Champions League. But their abilities are certain to be tested on Sunday night in a first vs third clash against Marseille at a packed 67,394-capacity Stade Velodrome. A difficult April schedule makes it important that PSG stay top of the table in Marseille, having struggled to maintain a title challenge for much of the season. Gaitan is viewed as the key man for Benfica as they look to open up a gap on Porto in Portugal. Manager Jorge Jesus said Gaitan is a star of different characteristics to his other players, with no equal. With nearest rivals Porto faltering, A Bola in France focus on Nicolas Gaitan's position as Benfica's leader as they look to wrap up the Primeira Liga title in the coming weeks. Benfica boss Jorge Jesus said of Gaitan: 'Nico is a player of different characteristics, we have no equal to him. 'He's a player with a lot of influence and he can be with us for many years. He is a leader on the pitch and it's good to know that he will be with us.'

CLIFF,cnndm,cc2192d92c3879b211708ad88350e643b331640d,"When Jack Wilshere was first showing signs of his enormous potential at Luton Town’s academy, the big boys down the road soon came calling. Everyone was into little Wilshere, with West Ham (the team his dad Andy supports), Tottenham and Arsenal all offering to give Luton’s academy kid a shot at the highest level. Wilshere was a Hitchin boy, spotted early by Luton’s scouts before Arsenal took him to their Hale End academy at nine. At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger’s side. Charlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town. Soon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder. The Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season. ‘We just want what’s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,’ said dad Julio on Wednesday. ‘He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.’. Charlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. ‘Other parents have commented on it in the past,’ admitted Julio. The big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA’s compensation guidelines. The transfer fee involved is £10,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton. There are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision. Charlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost £10,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton. 11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona. Julio’s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports. Julio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: ‘Charlie doesn’t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.’. Charlie’s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents’ home in London Colney, Hertfordshire. Soon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball. He has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton’s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club. Julio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London’s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago. Charlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball. He trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road) The Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time. ‘Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,’ added his dad. ‘He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.’. The Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club’s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed. Julio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club. ‘Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,’ he added. ‘They have really looked after Charlie over the years.’.

CLIFF,cnndm,bc16017daf093ed9afc7a6e8ce3cdc78b21c382c,"REJECTION PROOF. by Jia Jiang. (Random House, £13.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it’s galling. And in every case there’s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn’t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn’t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there’s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) . The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of ‘quest’ books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn’t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch’s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying ‘Free refill’, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. ‘When are you looking for these?’ she asked. ‘In the next . . . 15 minutes?’. ‘Let me see what I can do,’ she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it’s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang’s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else’s opinion, and it may not be the right one.  .","Jia Jiang spent 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected.

The midfielder's representatives are fully aware of Inter's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer. City want to keep Toure, who currently earns £220,000-per-week, and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season, which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over. But Inter will test City's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England. The 31-year-old scored a consolation goal in Manchester City's surprise 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace . Toure walks off the Selhurst Park pitch following his side's Premier League defeat at Selhurst Park.  .",Yaya Toure will be offered a new contract by Manchester City in the summer.

Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved, The West Australian reported. It's understood Mr Prabowo penned a letter to Mr Joko at the weekend in which he said that if the president were to 'postpone the executions indefinitely', he would come out in support of the decision. Scroll down for video . Indonesian President Joko Widodo (left) ignored reassurances from his chief political rival Prabowo Subianto (right) that he would support a decision to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved. Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he was told earlier in the year by human rights advocates that Mr Prabowo - who narrowly lost the presidential elections to Mr Joko in October - was 'very sympathetic' to clemency. As well, he could see that the executions of Chan and Sukumaran could damage relations between Australia and Indonesia. 'I was advised at the time that it would be a bad idea to approach him, so I didn't,' Senator Xenophon told ABC radio. 'One view was that it would enrage President Widodo and make matters worse, and I guess we'll never know.' . This comes after a senior Indonesian government official praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair and six other convicted drug traffickers. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work.  . 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March. Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did. Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution. The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. . 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' . Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak.

This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash . CLERMONT AUVERGNE: N Abendanon; N Nakaitaci, J Davies, W Fofana, N Nalaga; B James, L Radosavljevic; V Debaty, B Kayser, D Zirakashvili, J Cudmore, S Vahaamahina, J Bonnaire, D Chouly (capt), J Bardy. SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt — captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. . With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games. In these big games it's often about adapting to the situation and we know we have got a few strings to our bow.' Against a Clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field, Saracens will need all those strings.

Another passenger told the Sydney Morning Herald  of the horror and panic of being on board while the ship was battered had left her traumatised.

Seven-year-old Charlotte Briggs was told she cannot attend Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window. . Her mother Lynne, 49, who has two other children, claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job. Unhappy: Charlotte Briggs, seven, was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away, so her mother Lynne, pictured together,  must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back. Decision: The schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to Shooters Grove Primary, which is around two miles away. Mrs Briggs had believed Broomhill Infants School in Sheffield, where Charlotte is a student, was a feeder school to Lydgate Junior, so only put one school on Charlotte's admission form. The mother - who works in IT for Sheffield City Council and is married to financial planner Simon, 55, - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor. But the council said the school Charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying. Charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed, so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her. Mrs Briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away. She said: 'I know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment, we live about as close to the school as possible. . Rejected: Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School (above) in Sheffield, even though she can see it from her bedroom window. 'Parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at Lydgate Juniors. 'The council uses an ""as the crow flies"" criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if I look out of my landing window, all that stands between us and the school are the Kings Court OAP flats and a couple of houses. 'I've been told Broomhill is no longer a feeder school and all the places have been allocated at other infant schools. 'I have looked at bus timetables. I wouldn't be able to drop Charlotte off at school and get into town for work. It would take an hour and five minutes each way twice a day. I simply wouldn't be able to do it.' Jayne Ludlam, the council's executive director of children, young people and families said: 'We do understand that it is difficult if a child cannot be offered a place at their preferred school. . 'We always encourage parents to submit three preferences in case their first preference cannot be accommodated. . Alternative: The seven-year-old was instead offered a place at Shooters Grove - more than two miles away. 'Broomhill Infant School is not and has never been a linked feeder school to Lydgate Junior School and a member of the Admissions Team attended Broomhill in October 2014 to offer help and advice to parents before applying. 'If only one preference is submitted and cannot be accommodated, a place may have to be offered at the nearest school with available places. This may be a school outside the catchment area, if no other preferences were requested. 'If a family has specific reasons for seeking a place at an oversubscribed school they can submit an appeal to the independent appeals panel, which will convene in June and July.' Mrs Briggs said she has contacted her local prospective parliamentary candidates in Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's constituency of Sheffield Hallam - but has yet to receive a reply. . She added: ‘The school she has been allocated is down into one valley and down the other side. It's ridiculous. If we were to go by bus it would be a bus into town and then another one out. ‘It would take an hour and five minutes to get to school. We are appealing the decision but we won't find out until July what the outcome is, which is very late for us to plan and buy uniforms.’.",Charlotte Briggs refused a place at Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield.,Pegasus,test,['intrinsic-predicate'],['refused']

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. . Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. . His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. . She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. . Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. . 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges. 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.'  . When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'","Christopher Bridger, 25, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions.

The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper played every round of Newcastle’s run but was dropped in favour of Steve Harper for the Wembley showpiece, won 2-0 by Sir Alex Ferguson’s side. Given has yet to experience a truly fulfilling visit to the national stadium. He played in the 1998 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, as well as the semi-final defeat to Chelsea in 2000. Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . He has an FA Cup winners’ medal from 2011 but was an unusued substitute for the final against Stoke with Joe Hart in net. He is out to make amends against Liverpool. ‘It was nice to be part of winning it with Man City but when you don’t play it doesn’t have the same value,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where my medal is to be honest. ‘1999 was a bit of a slap in the face. Do you ever get over it, I suppose? It’s not an easy one. Ruud Gullit didn’t even tell me, he got the goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe to tell me I wasn’t playing. ‘But you can’t look back in football, you’ve just got to look forward. I’d love to win a trophy and make a bit of history at Aston Villa.’. The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets. Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39. Manager Tim Sherwood has confirmed Given, who turns 39 tomorrow, will keep his Cup place rather than be replaced by No 1 Brad Guzan. Given has played every round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and make key saves along the way. . Given admitted he felt matches of this magnitude had passed him by when he was out on loan at Middlesbrough last season, as Lambert jettisoned players he needed to remove off the wage bill. Last April, he was in the dugout assisting Villa’s former manager as coach when Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended. ‘I am employed by Aston Villa and I felt I could help out,’ said Given. ‘Life is too short to have grudges.’. Sherwood watched his Villa side in training as they prepare for the Sunday's crunch clash. Sherwood, his former Blackburn teammate, has provided a ‘new lease of life’. . ‘Tim is a very ambitious guy, he wants to keep the club in the Premier League and win the FA Cup. There have been occasions this season where people have seen the angry side. But ten minutes later he is putting his arm around the same player. One of his best skills is man management. He knows how to get the best out of people.’. Given has regained his place in the Ireland team and is wants to play at Euro 2016 should his country qualify. He would also like to take the goalkeeping shirt off Brad Guzan in the Premier League. He has a year left on his contract this summer and will discuss his prospects with Sherwood. ‘This run has shown I’m still capable and hopefully it gives a seed of doubt into the manager’s head as well that if he wants to mix it up in the Premier League.’ .

Adam Leheup, 34, allegedly  insisted on having sex with the 25-year-old woman despite her shouting: 'No, no.'  . Leheup met the woman on July 9, 2013 after arranging to meet on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Adam Leheup met with his alleged victim after making contact with her through the 'Let's Date App' They arranged to meet under the clock on Waterloo Station before crossing the bridge over to the Embankment where they went to Gordon's Wine Bar. . Leheup, who is a University of Greenwich graduate and technical co-ordinator on the £500m Nine Elms Point development, denies raping the woman. . Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Leheup missed his last train home to Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, so the alleged victim allowed him to come home with her to her flat in Camden during the early hours of July 10, 2013. He said they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. In a statement to police, the alleged victim said: 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked. He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: ""No"" a lot, but he was not listening. 'I was saying: ""No"", but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: ""Girl’s say: No, but they don’t mean it."" I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Prosecutor Mr Ish Sheikh told the court the couple met on dating app ‘Let’s Date’ - which connects users who mutually find each other attractive - and had two bottles of wine at Gordons Wine Bar, Embankment after meeting and walking across Waterloo Bridge. It was so late Leheup had missed his last train and his date agreed to put him up for the night. 'She made it clear nothing would happen and they went to a second bar, ""Joe’s"", in Camden where they had mojitos. Leheup went to Gordon's Wine Bar, pictured, with his alleged victim before going back to Camden together. Leheup has pleaded not guilty to raping the 25-year-old girl at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured. 'He started kissing my neck and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but it wasn’t vicious or nasty and later I did kiss him back. We were getting on well,' the woman told police in a video interview. 'The kissing had got a bit more aggressive, stuff I did not like, his hand on my throat, which makes me vulnerable. 'I said: ""Nothing is going to happen."" I’m not that kind of girl. Mr Sheikh added: 'The defendant was also a bit funny towards her when she was talking to other men at the bar.' They returned to the complainant’s flat in the early hours. 'She shares it with two others and when they got into the bedroom she changed into jogging bottoms and a top and got into bed, where the defendant joined her without any clothes on at all. 'He started kissing her and got on top of her and she was shouting: ""No, no,"" and to stop, but he did not take any heed of these cries and touched her with his fingers.' Partial intercourse occurred for a very short time and the young woman managed to get away and told Leheup: 'Why did you do that when I said no?' Mr Sheikh explained: 'One of the flatmates was woken because of the shouting and told Mr Leheup to leave, but he wouldn’t because he said he had work the next day and wanted to wait until the trains started running. The flatmate threatened to call the police and Leheup clambered down scaffolding outside the balcony door, but was arrested on the way to the underground station. When questioned by police the defendant said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. 'He said he was fondling her breasts and there was no talk of sex one way or the other. 'When they arrived at the bedroom he said she said words to the effect of: ""Welcome to my crack den."" 'He said he took her bra off because she wanted a back massage with some oil and they began kissing. 'He said he got on top of her her and she then freaked out and as soon as she did he got off her,' explained Mr. Sheikh. 'He said he climbed down the scaffolding to avoid a confrontation. 'When she was shouting: ""No"" he should have known she was not consenting. He was not going to take no for an answer that night.' The young woman admits she was under the influence of alcohol. 'I was probably more drunk than I should have been. I was feeling a bit giddy, a bit tipsy, but I was not falling over.' The trial continues.  .

But attempting to recreate these amazing pictures is now much more difficult - and in some cases impossible - as a result of a clampdown on the use of drones for photographic purposes. New Zealand photographer Amos Chapple travelled the world during the 18 months with a quadcopter in his backpack between 2012 and 2014 when it was easier to take aerial pictures using a drone. Since then restrictive laws and regulations have been implemented across the world, due to privacy concerns, commercial rights and worries about damage to property or crashes in the air with other aircraft. . From capturing the street scene in Barcelona to the majestic glory of the Taj Mahel, his photographs of some of the world’s most far-flung and enchanting places could become ‘one of a kind’ as he re-posted them under a new blog post: 'My Aerial Drone Shots Would Be Totally Illegal Today'. ‘There was a window of about 18 months where it was possible to fly these things anywhere and people were excited to see it’, Mr Chapple told Business Insider. ‘I’m glad I made use of that time.’.

High above Barcelona, clouds while through the pillars of Sagrat Cor Church. The authorities in charge of sites and cities like that have introduced tough new regulations to stop similar pictures being taken in the future, over privacy concerns and commercial rights. Mr Chapple travelled across Europe on his photographic mission, visiting the star fort at Bourtange, Netherlands, for these pictures. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque - or the 'Blue Mosque' - in Istanbul, Turkey is seen against a much wider backdrop thanks to this birds-eye view. The aerial view of Barcelona showcase the octagonial city blocks, designed to allow light and space on the street corners. Chapple captured a 'unique' perspective of a barge chugging along the Magdeburg Water Bridge, passing over the Elbe river in Germany.

With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff. Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014. .  .",Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished 14th in the Tour of Flanders.

Speaking during an engagement in London last month, she said that her second child is due 'mid to late April'. Scroll down for video . Due today? The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due 'mid to late April' during a visit last month. Kate, 33, who was touring the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford with Prince William, added: 'Not long to go now.' Although April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date, royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such. 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date,' a Kensington Palace source told MailOnline. 'The Duchess herself said mid to late April and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we've never confirmed anything and we never will.' However, the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, although tomorrow and Friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1. The Duchess is currently thought to be staying at Kensington Palace, a short drive from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital where she is due to give birth. Popular: The 25th is the favourite but the Palace says neither that date or any other has been confirmed. Preparations: The police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the Lindo Wing yesterday. Yesterday, police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the Duchess' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart. According to a statement released by Kensington Palace the same day, the new baby's father, Prince William, has  finished his Air Ambulance training early and will now avoid the two-hour dash from Norfolk that some had predicted. 'The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated,' the statement read. 'This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned. 'As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.' Fans: Royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital, among them Terry Hut, 71. Ready to go: The scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for Prince George in 2013. Back in town: The Palace has said Prince Harry will be in London this weekend before returning to Australia. But concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign, with Prince William due to attend a wreath-laying service at the Cenotaph on Saturday. The ceremony, which is also being held to mark ANZAC Day, will be mirrored by another taking place in Turkey which is due to be attended by the Prince of Wales and Prince Harry. Kensington Palace have also said that rather than return directly to Australia, where he is currently taking part in training exercises with the Australian Defence Force, Harry will briefly travel back to London instead.

A drunken restaurant owner has been banned from keeping animals after he was caught on CCTV punching, kicking and throwing his dog across the room. David Nellist, 38, of Keswick, Cumbria was foiled after a neighbour heard the young spaniel cross called Coco 'screaming'. . Nellist was sentenced to two months in prison, suspended for 18 months, banned from keeping animals for five years, ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work and pay costs of £1,580 at Workington Magistrates Court in Cumbria last week. . The court was told the incident took place early on Monday January 19 at the tapas bar Nellist co-owned at the time of the incident in Keswick.

'She told us the sound continued intermittently, causing her to be so concerned that she actually got up, left her home and followed the noise to the restaurant,' Mr Fletcher said. 'This was 3.30am.' CCTV footage from several cameras inside the restaurant showed Nellist beating the dog. Mr Fletcher said: 'There is no audio recorded on it, but it’s horrible to watch. 'He’s seen pursuing her relentlessly as she moves from room to room, clearly frightened and trying to get away from him. . 'He repeatedly punches her, kicks her and on two occasions picks her up by the throat and throws her across the room onto the ground. . 'It’s not difficult to imagine what might have happened had it not been for the actions of the neighbour.'

As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya.

No chorus of boos or whistles would stop the sweet strike rising above the 1950s tower blocks in the Colombes suburbs, with the ice cool 31-year-old mobbed by players and coaches as Racing Metro 92 were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition. It was the South American’s finest moment since he arrived on continental shores. Referee Nigel Owens was escorted off the pitch by security but his call –penalising replacement lock Fabrice Metz with 10 seconds left on the clock – was the correct decision and ensured a classic finale to match bereft or flair and finesse. . Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92.

Tries: Nil Penalties: Hodgson (2), Goode, Bosch Conversions: Nil . ‘The last time I kicked to win the game was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina,’ said Bosch. 'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’. It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland. The retired No 10, now kicking coach for the Top 14 side, watched helplessly from the stands of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir as the ball sailed between the posts to set up a knockout meeting with Clermont in Saint Etienne. .

They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb.  . Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins. .

We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’. Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment.

Introduced to the company via a mutual friend in the U.S., the girls knew it was a match made in heaven. 'We both have a love of colour and prints and so we said lets do something crazy together,' says Stef. Scroll down for video . Quirky collab: Sister duo Jess and Stef Dadon have teamed up  with  New York company ' Print All Over Me' Cocktails and creativity: The sisters are heading to LA soon for summer to launch new shoe line 'Twoobs' The photo-shoot was their own idea, which according to Jess they 'threw together' because they didn't think the collaboration on its own had enough of their signature look that is all about over-the -top colours and accessories. While the duo look posed and polished in the pics, they let us in on a little secret, according to the 'How Two Live' girls, they insist they don't actually like modelling, despite the 1732 posts on Instagram that would suggest otherwise. 'We don’t like to model, so we decided to add wigs and sunnies so we can hide behind them and they don’t see us,' says Jess. Candy coloured palettes: Stef, 27 (left) and Jess, 22 (right) Dadon have over 111,000 followers on Instagram. Steph says they use the term 'modelling' loosely as they don't see themselves as professional models, they just happen to be in the photos showcasing the clothes. . The photo shoot which took place in Sydney's Luna Park provided the perfect backdrop for the crazy, clown-like antics of the collaboration. 'They closed the park for the day so we had a couple of hours to take over and shoot. It provided the perfect creepy abandoned backdrop.' Model shy:The girls admit while they love wearing clothes, they are actually camera shy. Theme this: Sydney's theme park 'Luna Park' was the backdrop for their crazy colour pop collaboration. The shoes featured are also as part of the collaboration and are from the brand 'Buffalo Shoes' which are the same brand who sky-rocketed platforms into the mainstream  when they were famously worn by the Spice Girls during the 90s. 'We'd been collaborating with the guys from Buffalo shoes but we weren't sure what our following would think, so we posted a pic on Instagram and everyone has been dying over them - so it's had a great response,' says Jess. . While the  photo shoot for their current collaboration only took a quick 45 minutes, the Dadon sisters had a lot of other projects  keeping them busy. Down-to-earth duo:  45 minutes is all it took to string together the glamour shots as seen throughout. Pop princesses: The platforms  made by Buffalo Shoes are the same company made famous by the Spice Girls. First there's their new shoe label, titled 'Twoobs,' coming out in  June in America. 'We  did a shoe collaboration with Windsor Smith a year and a half ago and once we got a taste for shoes we fell in love,' says Jess. 'This first line will be all about sandals with  flat and platform soles,'she said. According to Jess,  platforms are a must because they're much more comfortable than heels - 'you’re feet won't be sore at the end of the night and you still get the height.' Flair for fashion: With a natural knack for fashion the girls are now releasing a 'how-to' book titled #howtolive. Colour craziness: 'How To Live' have become well known thanks to their colourful Australian style. Questioned why America is their first market, the sisters admit escaping to summer weather is their biggest appeal, especially as their based most of the year in Melbourne (known for it's southerly chill). 'We’re going to go for three months then decide if we'll stay on permanently. We love L.A., and we already have a fan base and  connections to the shoe industry over there so it just made sense,' says Stef. They also have a book in the works, with the very insta-worthy title ' #howtwolive' coming out in September. . Celebrity scene: In their short two and a half years of blogging they've met  Rachel Zoe and Anna Dello Russo. The book offers 36 'how-two' projects including fashion, recipes and nail art ideas. As for more collaborations? There's more on the cards but according to the girls it's still under tight wraps at the moment. Not that the fashion bloggers will need any help with exposure. The duo have met a lot of fashion royalty in the two and a half years since their blog's conception - with highlights including   Rachel Zoe at New York Fashion Week and  Anna Dello Russo when they guest edited for Elle Girl Japan. Fame and fortune aside, at the end of the day all the girls really care about is representing fashion. 'In the Australian blogging scene, everyone does the same thing, so we decided early on our goal was to bring colour into the Australian market,' says Jess. Patriotic pair: Despite business endeavours in the U.S. they take pride in representing Australian designers. And it's their vibrant and uniquely Australian approach that seems to be working. 'When we met Rachel Zoe we were wearing an amazing Australian designer Natasha Fagg and she came up to us and was like ‘""I love what you’re wearing, you girls look so crazy,""' says Jess. . 'It also helps that we were wearing big sunnies, very Rachel Zoe, she adds. 'We love to promote Australian designers when we're overseas. When we guest edited Elle Girl, it was so cool to have people from Japan come up and ask us who we were wearing,' she said. Despite their recent success, the duo from Melbourne remain down-to-earth about their life and even admit that despite receiving the odd gifts here and there they prefer to buy all their own clothes. 'It's flattering to receive gifts but we're a bit picky and it's always better to buy what you love and stay true to what your style is,' says Jess. .",Fashion duo Jess and Stef Dadon have teamed up with New York company' Print All Over Me' The sisters are heading to LA soon for summer to launch new shoe line' Twoobs',Pegasus,test,correct,

CLIFF,cnndm,0246ddab6a44f81d1b3cfb6d8f3c156d1096158f,"Wayne Rooney knows Champions League qualification is Manchester United's to lose, making this weekend's clash with Aston Villa all the more important. Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League. United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield. The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half. However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday. 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.'

Just three months after Silver himself was arrested on corruption charges, his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch, 37, was accused of running a $7million Ponzi scheme. . The Brooklyn resident was in court on Monday as prosecutors accused him of lying to investors about stock losses and pocketing most of the money entrusted to him for trading.

According to the complaint, Trebitsch took millions from investors, promising to invest their money in large-cap stocks through his mutual fund. . However, prosecutors say he only invested a fraction of the money and used the rest to finance his family and pay back other clients. Meanwhile, he allegedly lied to investors about what money he did invest, sending them fake account statements and tax forms that showed them posting positive returns along the lines of his promised 14 to 16 per cent - keeping 'enormous trading losses' secret. Trebitsch ran the scheme from 2009 through December 2014, according to the complaint. . Trebitsch has been charged with securities and wire fraud and is currently free on $500,000 bond.

CLIFF,cnndm,be50bd56517bf4240402fbdeadaffd7f705e8d9a,"Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers. Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract. Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania  . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United. Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club. If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract. I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

CLIFF,cnndm,15adbace5ad32429ac3e85d964602b70bbae469f,"It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway,. But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night. Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback. Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern. Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' . Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto. Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova. And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.  .",Thiago scored in Bayern Munich's 6 - 1 win over Porto on Tuesday night.

The model has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. In an interview with the Evening Standard, the  model admitted that the most surprising thing in her handbag is the tester kit, which she uses to check her state of alkaline. Scroll down for video . Elle Macpherson, who turned 51 last month, has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. Elle said: '(The most surprising thing in my handbag is) a pH balance urine tester kit to check that I'm in an alkaline state. I believe that most ailments come from having an acidic body.' The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. . An alkaline body can be achieved by eating the right foods (lots of leafy greens) and exercising. Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times, and the Britain's Next Top Model host puts her figure down to 'variation' and 'consistency'. The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. Elle is well-known for her healthy diet and even released her own superfood product, The Super Elixir. She said: 'Variation is key. I work out 45 minutes a day, six days a week, combining hiking, water skiing, swimming and running on a beach. '(My idea of a healthy diet is) consistency and eating three healthy meals a day. Having said that, red meat, wheat and dairy don't work for me.' Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she's unveiled her very own brand. . Last year, Elle introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug. She hasn't aged a day! Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle, pictured, left, in 1995 and, right, in 2012,  has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times. The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking to FEMAIL at the time about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor ""I don't feel great"". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.' Elle has co-created The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein, which is made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao and a product that the supermodel credits for helping her get ready for beach holidays .

Munroe said: 'I had always known growing up that I was supposed to be a woman, but I'd always tried to hide it for fear of being different. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate. 'But I remember being about 17 and wondering how different my life would be if I didn't care what people think. . 'It was then that it suddenly hit me - it was time to start being true to myself,' she said. 'I came out as gay to begin with at 15 and then I started dressing up as a woman and doing drag around three years later,' said Munroe. 'Soon I started the slow process to transition into a woman, it was the best decision I've ever made. Now (left) and then (right): Munroe has transformed into a sexy beauty after growing up as a boy. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate,' she says.

'It's like going through puberty again so I got quite self-conscious about the way I looked and dressed, and I felt as though I started to think differently.' 'I didn't really like explaining what was going on to people as I was doing this for myself, but friends and family were curious,' she said. 'My mum found out what was going on when she noticed my chest growing - it was a shock at first but she's very supportive. 'As soon as I noticed the change in myself it was like I wasn't ashamed any more,' she said. Munroe has now been taking hormones for four years, and has embraced her new life. She said: 'When I left university I got involved in fashion and the PR industry. 'I've had the opportunity of working with some incredible brands, designers and photographers, and I just love it.

Now the adventure has been re-created in a new film, showing the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they wander incognito through the city streets. And among the most curious viewers of A Royal Night Out, released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945, will be a woman who knows better than anyone what really happened on that extraordinary night. Scroll down for video . Royal Role: Canadian Sarah Gadon, left. plays a young Princess Elizabeth, pictured right. Dancing Queen: Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth enjoying a night out to celebrate the end of the Second World War. Because she was there. ‘It was a Cinderella moment in reverse,’ says The Hon Margaret Rhodes, 89, first cousin to the Queen and her best friend. ‘It was wonderful bedlam. I can’t remember whose idea it was. It was just one of those things that happened.’. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home at Windsor Great Park, she says: ‘I think it’s one of the things that the Queen remembers with great happiness. Neither of them had ever done anything remotely similar, being let loose in a crowd like that to walk all the way from Buckingham Palace through to Trafalgar Square. ‘Everyone was kissing everybody and picking up hats and throwing them away. It was euphoria at its most euphoric!’. Mrs Rhodes, then young Margaret Elphinstone, was lodging at Buckingham Palace while working as a secretary for the military intelligence service MI6. She recalls how a small gang including 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, 15, and Mrs Rhodes’s brothers, left the Palace by the Privy Gate. ‘With the best will in the world, I can’t remember if Princess Elizabeth kissed anyone, but kisses were being thrown about very liberally,’ she says. ‘It was like we had all been living under a huge, heavy, dark cloud. And suddenly, it had gone. I’m so old now, I’m literally the only other person left alive who was there with them on VE Day.’. The Queen is said to remember the night with 'great happiness' In the film, which stars Canadian actress Sarah Gadon as the future Queen and British newcomer Bel Powley as Princess Margaret, the sisters are shown wearing cocktail dresses for their adventure. In real life, Princess Elizabeth was wearing her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform. Mrs Rhodes says: ‘In order not to be recognised, the Queen pulled her cap right down over her eyes and one of the officers who was with us said, “Look, I’m not going about with an officer who can’t wear her cap properly,” so she had to put it back. Mrs Rhodes adds: ‘I always thought it was very clever of the King and Queen Elizabeth [the Queen Mother] to let the girls go out into the night, with all those myriad of people around them. They knew it was something the Queen and Princess Margaret would never forget.’. Princess Elizabeth is also shown forming a brief attachment with a young serviceman called Jack, who takes her gambling and to a Soho brothel. ‘That didn’t happen,’ laughs Mrs Rhodes, whose younger self does not feature in the film. ‘Apparently, Princess Margaret escapes on the top deck of a bus. That never happened.’. Princess Margaret is also shown quite drunk. ‘No! There was no possibility. We never encountered anyone offering one a drink,’ insists Mrs Rhodes, the daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone. One of the true scenes in the film is of the Royal party dancing the conga through the Ritz. ‘The smart old ladies having drinks were gobsmacked,’ says Mrs Rhodes, although it actually happened on VJ night, August 15 – when Britain celebrated Japan’s surrender. The princesses were protected on their VE Day jaunt by Captain Harold Campbell RN, equerry to Princess Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. ‘He was deeply disapproving of the whole manoeuvre,’ says Mrs Rhodes. The party returned to the Palace after midnight. ‘It was emancipation,’ says Mrs Rhodes. ‘I don’t think anybody realises what she has had to give up. You give up your independence. Poor Princess Margaret is dead, but that night is something I know the Queen will never forget.’. ...And she recorded a secret song tape . Friends: Margaret Rhodes, left with Princess Margaret and Elizabeth, right. By Michael Powell. The Queen and Princess Margaret recorded a secret tape of children’s songs as a touching gift for their mother on her 90th birthday, it has been revealed. Pianist and composer Laurie Holloway has told for the first time how his friend Princess Margaret phoned him with the idea, days before the Queen Mother’s milestone birthday in August 1990. He was summoned to Buckingham Palace and taken to an upstairs room ‘where there was a dark brown, walnut grand piano and two microphones. There was also a sound engineer who I think they had got in from the BBC’. Mr Holloway said the Queen, then 64, and Princess Margaret, then 59, wanted to sing quite unusual children’s songs. ‘One was called I Know Where The Flies Go In Winter Time,’ he said. ‘The Queen said they were taught them by their mother’s father, the Earl of Strathmore. We rehearsed them a few times and then we recorded them in one take each.’. Mr Holloway, 77, musical director on Strictly Come Dancing for its first three series, said the Royal sisters sang ‘very well, beautifully in fact’ during the two-hour recording session. ‘The Queen has a nice, sweet tone to her voice,’ he added. He said Margaret told him the Queen Mother loved the gift. ‘She said that when they gave it to her at Windsor, the Queen Mother said she didn’t have anything to play it on, so they had to go out to the car to listen to it. ‘Later, Prince Charles arrived and wanted to listen to it. They told him he would have to go out to the car and to everyone else’s surprise he opened a cupboard and there was all the latest stereo equipment right there.’. Sadly, the cassette went missing after the Queen Mother’s death in 2002, although Mr Holloway wonders if a copy might still exist somewhere.  .","A Royal Night Out is released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945.

CLIFF,cnndm,20aaaf9357b437f83ac7745f02b71d4e93d8753f,"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)The question haunting Kiev is this: Who might be murdering allies of Ukraine's ousted President Viktor Yanukovych? The idea that this might be happening is not entirely new. But it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high-profile shooting deaths in the Ukrainian capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to Yanukovych, the other of a Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views. Oleg Kalashnikov, the former member of parliament, was shot and killed shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday at the entrance to his apartment block. Kalashnikov, 52, was a member of the Party of Regions, the former ruling party in Ukraine, and was close to Yanukovych. Police are investigating the death as a murder. A day later, on Thursday, journalist Oles Buzyna, 45, was killed near his home by shots fired from a dark blue Ford Focus, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. The car's license plates were reported to have been from either Latvia or Belorussia. The killings renewed speculation, sparked by earlier unusual deaths, about a conspiracy to kill people close to Yanukovych. At least three former members of parliament with the Party of Regions have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks:. • On February 28, Mikhail Chechetov reportedly jumped from the window of his 17th-floor apartment in Kiev, having left a suicide note. He was suspected of having falsified the results of a parliamentary vote in early 2014 that essentially prohibited protest just as thousands of people were protesting against the Yanukovych government. • On March 9, Stanislav Melnik, a former member of parliament with the Party of Regions and the manager of several businesses in the separatist-minded eastern city of Donetsk, was found dead in his apartment near Kiev. He, too, reportedly left a suicide note. • And three days later, on March 12, Oleksandr Peklushenko, another former member of parliament, was found in his house in Zaporizhzhya, in southeastern Ukraine, dead of a gunshot wound. Police are investigating various scenarios, including suicide. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said Peklushenko ""might have wanted to avoid punishment for using violence against protesters, which he was suspected of."" Ukraine is deeply divided, and it has been for years. About a third of the population speaks Russian as opposed to Ukrainian. Whether the country should be drawn into the orbit of Russia or the West is a visceral issue, a question for many Ukrainians not of politics but of identity. Recent events have deepened the divide. In 2014, after Yanukovych turned his back on the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia, he was driven from office by mass demonstrations. And with Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea and its support for Russian-speaking separatists in eastern Ukraine, the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war. With a government toppled and armed conflict in the east, Ukrainians have reason to want each other dead. But the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly, according to which side of the country's divide one is on. The Opposition Bloc, the country's major opposition party, has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- ""bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists,"" the bloc's media office called them. ""It is clear oppression of those who are not afraid to criticize the government,"" it said. The government, unsurprisingly, sees things differently. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who came to office after Yanukovych was ousted, has demanded an investigation of the killings of Kalashnikov and Buzyna, his media office said. ""It is evident that these crimes have the same origin,"" the media office quoted Poroshenko as saying. ""Their nature and political sense are clear. It is a deliberate provocation that plays in favor of our enemies. It is aimed at destabilizing the internal political situation in Ukraine and discrediting the political choice of the Ukrainian people."" And Anton Geraschenko, an adviser to the country's interior minister, took the theory one step further. ""It should not be excluded that the killings of Oleg Kalashnikov and Olez Buzyna were planned and organized from Moscow and are a part of a plan to destabilize Ukraine and further support anti-Ukrainian mood in Russian society,"" Geraschenko said.",At least three former members of parliament with Yanukovych's party have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks.,Pegasus,test,correct,
CLIFF,cnndm,b1ee39f2770dd3213d162a93cc4db439d02550c5,"Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is relishing the prospect of a long-awaited Wembley appearance after injury robbed him of the chance three years ago. The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final. Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final. 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted. 'We needed to bounce back after two disappointing results against Manchester United and Arsenal and we did that.

The glamorous gathering in Florence is just the latest in a series of glitzy jaunts for the jet-setting royal, who has faced criticism in recent weeks over the amount of time she spends abroad. In the last two months alone, she has enjoyed skil holidays in Verbier, where her parents own a luxury chalet, and Colorado, and travelled to Greece, New York and, most recently, Bahrain. There, she was joined by boyfriend Dave Clark and viewed the action from a private box beside the country's Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.

Unfortunately for Beatrice, her travelling days could be numbered with the Princess on the verge of relocating to the New York to take up a new job. The job, which is thought to be in finance, will be her first since leaving her internship at Sony following last November's cyber attacks. Since then, her life has been a round of parties and beaches, beginning with a trip to the Middle East to see the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix the same month. . Days later Beatrice and  Mr Clark, a Virgin Galactic executive, flew to Beijing, where they joined her mother Sarah Ferguson and sister Eugenie for the wedding of photographer and graphic designer Victoria Tang to Hong Kong lawyer Christopher Owen.

The 68-year-old blamed knee problems for his decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers in February. However, Redknapp told BBC Sport's Football Focus there was more to his decision than health problems. Ex-QPR boss Harry Redknapp has described the club as 'like a bit of a soap opera' after quitting in February. Striker Charlie Austin celebrates after scoring in QPR's 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday night. He said: 'I always thought I had everyone pulling with me and suddenly I felt some were and some weren't. I didn't know who was on my side at the end and who wasn't. 'Behind the scenes, I always thought there were one or two people with their own agendas. 'There was always talk about Tim Sherwood coming in. It was like a bit of a soap opera. 'QPR was in the paper every day. I've been at lots of other clubs, big clubs as well, where you didn't get that. That got on my nerves. That was the big problem for me. 'As soon as we lost a few games, it would begin. I always thought there was someone mischievous causing it. I'd never had that before at any club I'd been at. Redknapp was aware of constant talk of Tim Sherwood replacing him at Loftus Road earlier in the season. Former West Ham boss Redknapp believes he would have helped QPR avoid relegation. 'I didn't see the teams below us getting the same sort of headlines every other week. It wore me down a little bit.' Redknapp left the team second from bottom of the table and they are now two points from safety under the leadership of Chris Ramsey. However, Redknapp, who also claimed he did not fall out with chairman Tony Fernandes because of the club's lack of business in the January transfer window, added: 'I felt I'd have kept them up.'  .",Harry Redknapp resigned as QPR manager in February.

Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by just 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year, it is claimed. It follows last year’s record price hike of 17.4 per cent in the capital. Economists said that the housing market had ‘got ahead of itself’ last year and would assume a much more leisurely pace in 2015. Scroll down for video . Forecasts show house prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace. File photo. Annual price growth across the country will then gradually accelerate again over the next five years, hitting 4 per cent by 2020. This year will be the first since 2009 that the UK as a whole out-performs London, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. This is because while prices in the capital stagnate, the housing market is still performing well in the East and South-East, and parts of the Midlands and North of England. But the CEBR said this victory for the provinces would be short-lived, since the London market will also recover in 2016. Prices there are set to rise by 2.7 per cent next year, above the national average of 2.3 per cent. London homes will also suffer no more price falls in the foreseeable future – and are forecast to see annual growth of an estimated 4.7 per cent by 2020. The predictions from economists at the think-tank were upgraded from their forecast in January, when they suggested average prices would fall this year. They said that radical changes to stamp duty had given the market a boost. In recent years many Britons had been deterred from moving home for fear of the punitive tax on house purchases. The tax was charged on the whole value of a property and successive governments had failed to increase thresholds, trapping growing numbers of families above a £125,000 threshold. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year. File photo. But, in December, the Coalition overhauled the system, replacing the unfair ‘slab’ structure with gradually increasing rates, which cut tax bills for the vast majority of movers. . Economist Scott Corfe, of the CEBR, said: ‘House price growth in the UK will rise much slower than last year – but it will still be positive. ‘The market got a bit ahead of itself last year, and at the end of 2014 it began slowing down and plateaued. ‘It has now started to pick up again outside London. We are still not building enough houses to keep pace with population growth so, as long as we have a shortage of supply, prices will keep rising. ‘House prices will continue to grow faster than inflation.’. It was a different story in London, however, where he said interest from overseas buyers had dwindled, pushing down prices. While the stamp duty changes meant lower bills for the majority, those buying million-pound homes have been hit by higher rates – deterring international investors and many wealthy Londoners. Mr Corfe said: ‘Stamp duty reform, as well as the depreciation of the euro against the pound – making London more expensive for European buyers – has affected prices in the capital. ‘Uncertainty around the general election and fears of a mansion tax [under Labour’s plans] may have also driven down demand since the start of the year.’ .  .","Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by 1.5 per cent.

A Japan Railway maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour (374 miles per hour) on an experimental track in Yamanashi Tuesday, setting a decisive new world record. A spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour, during which it covered 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles). That's nearly 20 football fields in the time it took you to read the last two sentences. Takeo Ookanda, who runs an exhibition center next to the test track, said witnesses erupted with excitement and applause when the new record was set. ""I was moved just like many other visitors here today,"" he told CNN. ""This maglev project... (increases) the hope that Japan can have a good growth again in the future."" The train broke its own record from last Thursday, when it ran at 590 kilometers per hour (366 miles per hour) on a test track. That beat the old record of 581 kilometers per hour (361 miles per hour), which was set in 2003 during another Japanese maglev test. Right now, China operates the world's fastest commercial maglev, which has hit 431 kilometers per hour (268 miles per hour) on a route through Shanghai. By contrast, the fastest train in the United States, Amtrak's Acela Express, is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour), though it usually plods along at half that speed. Unlike traditional trains, maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward. Japan's maglevs don't use metal tracks — instead, they float nearly 10 cm (4 inches) above special guideways, allowing for frictionless movement. Japan Railways has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between Tokyo and Nagoya, scheduled to begin service in 2027. That trip can take nearly 5 hours by car. But in the future, a maglev train could finish the journey in 40 minutes. READ MORE: The future of transportation will blow your hair back.

CLIFF,cnndm,a17d8daa9e400e28165801e0ff07c4e47442121a,"Scott Kelley, now 50, has been arrested a decade after he fled the U.S with stepdaughter Mary Nunes, and her mother Genevieve Kelley. A teacher who fled the U.S. with his stepdaughter and her mother ten years ago has finally given himself up in Costa Rica. Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, gave surrendered at the U.S. embassy on Monday and were flown back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, where Kelley was arrested. The pair fled New Hampshire in 2004 along with Genevieve Kelley, Mary's mother, during a custody dispute with Mark Nunes, Genevieve's former husband and Mary's father. Genevieve, now 50, handed herself in last November, but refused to give up the location of her husband and daughter, who had not been seen for a decade until this week. Speaking to People magazine, Scott Kelley said: 'It was time to come home.' He is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due to face in court next month. Kelley's case dates back to December 2004 when Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness. However, Genevieve, also a physician, refused to hand the girl over, instead taking her to Colorado for a second opinion, where a doctor diagnosed her with acute post traumatic stress disorder. While in Colorado, Genevieve alleged that Mr Nunes had sexually abused the girl, and then fled to South America along with current husband Scott. The state Division of Children, Youth and Families investigated and said any claims of abuse were 'unfounded,' and instead concluded that Genevieve instead likely abused the girl. Charges were never brought, however, because by that point the Kelleys, along with Mary Nunes, had already vanished. Mary Nunes, disappeared when she was aged 8 (left), and is now aged 19 (digitally aged version, right). The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004. Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decade. Despite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year. Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward. Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding. But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe. Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home. Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed. Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hiding. Scott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custody. Mr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. . 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.' Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said. It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. . Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors. Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin. .","Scott Kelley, now 50, fled the U.S. with stepdaughter Mary Nunes in 2004.

The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: ""It was a joke, and no offense was meant."" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: ""We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real."" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised ""money back if he walks"" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius.

The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‘I’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,’ said the South African legend. ‘When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986. Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009. Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters. ‘Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.’. It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‘bulking up’ too much in the gym. ‘I’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don’t watch what they eat,’ he says. ‘Just because they’re lazy, they can’t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National. ‘I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn’t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‘I’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‘Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That’s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it’s so wrong.’ Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‘I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,’ he said. ‘I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I’d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‘I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011. Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament. ‘It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?’. Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends.

'I am expecting a superb Bayern team, regardless of who they will end up playing and we are prepared for what will happen.' Bayern are also without Javi Martinez and Mehdi Benatia, while winger Franck Ribery looks set to miss the game with a nagging ankle injury. Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger returned to team training on Monday but he is also doubtful to start having been out for weeks with an ankle injury and a subsequent virus.

Headteacher Linda Shute has banned children from consuming drinks - including tea, coffee, fruit juice and soft drinks - in a bid to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School in New Addington, south London. But some parents believe the water-only rule is too strict, claiming many children go all day without a drink because they do not like water. Scroll down for video . A headteacher is forcing primary school pupils to only drink water during the school day after banning all other drinks, including fruit juice. Samantha Moore, who launched the petition, said: 'As a mother, I have the right to choose what my son drinks.' Another campaigner, Anela, from Croydon, added: 'They should be able to drink whatever they want and not just water because some kids don't like water.' . Mrs Shute, who announced her aims by enforcing the rule in a school newsletter last month, said: 'The water-only policy is being very well supported by parents and children. 'Thank you for this and know in your hearts, if you have any doubts, this policy is for the long-term health of all your children.' But her move provoked a backlash from some, who branded it a 'joke'. Alan Fay said: 'It's about time that schools started looking after the kids again and stop just doing what is told by the powers above.' Gemma Irwin, from New Addington, added : 'I believe that it should be up to the parent what their child drinks. 'If teachers are allowed tea and coffee, why can't a child have a bottle of juice or flavoured water?' . But the school has defended its decision. The rule has been enforced to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School (pictured) in New Addington, south London. It follows a similar ban which sparked anger at Valence Primary School in Dagenham, east London, when it was introduced in January last year. Headteacher Elizabeth Chaplin brought in the new rule as part of a 'health drive' and drinks other than water were poured down the sink. In June last year, children at Carlton Central Infants' School in Nottingham, were barred from drinking fruit squash - a measure opposed by some parents. Tam Fry, chairman of the Child Growth Foundation and spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, is among campaigners who have pushed for healthy drink options in schools. He has praised schools that clamp down on sugar-filled juices, which he believes should be limited to one small glass a week. Mr Fry said: 'Fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar, and it needs to be a treat - not an everyday occurrence. The preference in schools should be water, which is hugely beneficial.'  .",Rowdown Primary School in south London has banned all other drinks.

A 39-year-old woman named Lillian Roldan came forward to author John Glatt to say she dated Castro from 2000 to 2003, a three-year period during which Castro kidnapped and imprisoned Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry in his Ohio home. Roldan describes Castro in Glatt's book The Lost Girls as nothing short of a gentleman, who was 'completely normal' in the bedroom, and even romantic. Scroll down for video . Blinded by love: Lillian Roldan (left) says she dated Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro (right) from 2000 to 2003. She says she visited his house often and never knew about the young women he was keeping prisoner. However, she says he did keep his basement padlocked, which she found peculiar. When she asked about the need to lock the door, Castro allegedly told Roldan that he kept his money stored down there and 'didn't want his kids to steal it'. . In the book set to be published later this month, Roldan recalls meeting 16-years-older Castro on a blind date set up by friends in May 2000. He allegedly invited her to watch him play music one night and it was 'love at first sight'. Under her nose: During the three years she was with Castro, he would kidnap 21-year-old Michelle Knight and 17-year-old Amanda Berry. A few months after breaking up, he kidnapped his third victim Gina DeJuses. Roldan pictured above with another man in a picture posted to Facebook.

Roldan visited Castro at his house often, and sometimes ran into his ex-wife Grimilda Figueroa. Castro abused Figuero during their marriage, but he acted so kind around Roldan that she thought the beatings were just a rumor. As for their sex life, Roldan says Castro was 'completely normal' and 'considerate'. . She says at one point during their relationship, Castro popped the question but Roldan declined since she didn't believe in marriage. .

They branded the problem ‘irritating’, ‘annoying’ and ‘frustrating’ and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. . Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system.  . But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. . It was raised by the BBC’s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: ‘Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? . 'All because you can’t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?’. Another added: ‘I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.’. Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes.

Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC’s Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: ‘There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can’t humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.’ .",Dad ’s Army and Hancock ’s Half Hour have fallen foul of the problem.

He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. ""He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,"" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a ""guerilla satirist."" The New York Times dubbed him the ""Che Guevara of advertising,"" and years later, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. ""Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,"" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. ""RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend."" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. ""Wun'erful Wun'erful,"" his 1957 spoof of ""champagne music"" — on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May — lampooned ""The Lawrence Welk Show."" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit ""Cry,"" which Freberg rendered as ""Try."" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including ""St. George and the Dragonet,"" a 1953 send-up of the series ""Dragnet."" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, ""That's Rich."" Three years later, he presented ""The Stan Freberg Show"" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: ""Mad Men's"" return. He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for ""The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows."" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy ""Time for Beany,"" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an ""office"" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show ""Toast of the Town."" Hollywood Reporter: ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" -- the untold story. Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as ""Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,"" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in ""Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was ""More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,"" and he even had a corporate motto: ""Ars Gratia Pecuniae"" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon ""What's Brewin', Bruin,"" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's ""Three Little Bops."" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, ""Back in Action"" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear. Survivors also include his wife, Hunter, and a granddaughter. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.

It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. . Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point. The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley. He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos.

Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute.

CLIFF,cnndm,13ae16f71b19eca4673c71cccaa51f0813e21bae,"Starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little-known British company to avoid paying taxes across Europe. The U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills. It could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal. For the first time yesterday, details emerged about the UK company at the heart of the probe, which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch government. Probe: Starbucks ran its European division - including the UK - through the Netherlands, but it paid just £1.9million in tax to the Dutch government, from a reported £300million profit. Starbucks ran its European business, including its booming UK division, through the Netherlands where it paid almost no tax on its profits. But it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct British entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the Dutch taxman. By registering its Intellectual Property – such as its brand and logo – in a UK company called Alki LP, it was able to pay hefty sums from its Netherlands division into Britain. Its Dutch division paid just £1.9million of tax, despite reporting profits of £300million – a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the UK entity, including a claim that it had not a single registered employee. Starbucks has already been called ‘immoral’ by MPs for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the UK. Schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in Switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark-up to the Netherlands, where they are then roasted before being sold on again to Britain. This means that much of the money it makes from UK sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes. Revealed: It is now claimed the company, which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices, may have used a British company to put hefty sums from its Netherlands branch into the UK. Between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in Britain, despite racking up combined sales of more than £3billion here. But after its tactics were exposed, the company offered to pay a voluntary £20million in tax to avoid a public boycott. Now details of a little-known tax division have emerged. A UK-registered holding business called Alki LP was set up to house the branding of the business. In a bizarre move, Alki appeared to have no employees – and was registered at the offices of Starbuck’s tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie. Compliance: A Starbucks spokesman said the company complies 'with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines' But because of the very limited details available, it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received – or whether it paid any tax in the UK. Accounts for Starbucks’ Dutch businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division. But without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the UK division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven. The business, which was closed down last year, has never filed proper accounts at Companies House. When it was dissolved, Alki was folded into a new company, Starbucks EMEA Holdings – though this business has also yet to file any accounts. This is an aspect that EU investigators believe is key to their probe. Earlier this year the British boss of Starbucks provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax for years. UK managing director Mark Fox said the company needed to get ‘its mojo back’ before it would begin to turn a profit. But he was confounded only weeks later when Starbucks reported its first ever UK profit of £1.1million – despite sales being a bumper £300million. On this it paid taxes of just £232,363, as well as the sum of £11.2million as part of its voluntary £20million tax payment. A Starbucks spokesman said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we continue to cooperate with the European Commission’s state aid investigation in the Netherlands.’ .  .",Starbucks embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs.

The haul of produce was even enough to keep some growers self-sufficient. But now the gardeners are at war with their council after they were moved to new allotments so their old prize-winning plots can be bulldozed to make way for a car park and five-a-side football pitches. Scroll down for video . Living the Good Life: Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years. But the Broadway Allotment Association member says soil at the group's new site is 'dreadful' Thriving: The association's allotments were moved by Oldham council. The old prize-winning site (pictured) has been bulldozed to make way for a car park and football pitches. Pay out: But gardeners have complained about their new site, saying it has bad drainage and poor soil. The association has called on the council to pay growers compensation for the problems they've experienced. Many are complaining that the soil in their new allotments is so poor they cannot grow a bean - and that the new plots' drainage is so bad that their seedlings are rotting in the ground. They are demanding that Oldham council pays out compensation for the problems - which have seriously curtailed their growing season. Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years and he and his wife, Margaret, 78, live the Good Life as they are largely self-sufficient. He said: ‘The soil is dreadful and the land is flooded. It is impossible to grow there so the allotments are not fit for purpose and need plenty of work. ‘I still have potatoes, leeks, parsnips, cabbage, broccoli, strawberries, raspberries and gooseberries in storage from last year’s crop but this year I’ ll be lucky to grow anything. 'Dreadful': Gardeners say the soil at their new site (pictured) is so poor they can't grow a bean.

The drainage (pictured left) is also so bad that the seedlings of allotment holders are rotting in the ground. They are demanding the council pays out compensation for the problems at the plots in Failsworth, Oldham. ‘My wife and I totally depend on the crop from my allotment each year as we have three freezers to store it and it keeps us going all year.’. Mr Fyson, who has two grandchildren and one great grandson, has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. He said: ‘I’ve done quite well over the year. But this year is going to be dreadful. I’ve been digging some trenches to drain the land and have had to bail out with a bucket. We won’t be able to grow anything of any quality here for quite a while.’.

Much-loved: One allotment holder, Michael Fyson, 77, has grown fruit and vegetables at the old site (pictured) for more than ten years. He has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. The plots managed by the Broadway Allotment Association in Failsworth, Oldham have been popular with residents since the 1930s and kept many fed during the Second World War. However growers have been moved to land a few hundred yards away as part of a plan to redevelop the nearby Lancaster Club off Broadway into a ‘garden suburb’. The development will include 144 homes, with the Grade II-listed club turned into apartments and a five-a-side football pitch and car park will be built on the former allotments. Oldham council developed the new site and constructed greenhouses and sheds for the growers in recompense for losing their original plots. Ian Wade, 55, association secretary, said: ‘I understand the need to redevelop the area and it would be okay if they had given us a plot that worked. ‘But the soil they have put down is ridiculous. It has powdered brick, rubble, sand and stones in it and it is impossible to grow anything in it. ‘Gardeners can work to improve the soil but it is so shocking nothing will grow for years. The site is also flooded and seems impossible to drain.’. Now, the 17 tenants are calling on the council to give them compensation for the delay they will face in growing their produce and the extra work in making the land fit.

However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces. Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different. Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' . Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA. One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments. Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests. Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. . Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. . Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. . Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.'  . Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.'   . Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment. One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited. If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write. Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.'  .

Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. . Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian. He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. . Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts. Toure has more than two years left on his current £220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy — although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. . City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao. Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

Some are charging up to a ‘shameful’ £2,700 for one eye – treble what it costs the health service – raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of £6,000 each. . Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. . Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery themselves. The operation usually costs the NHS between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: ‘It’s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. Scroll down for video . ‘We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.’. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. ‘It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. ‘Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.’. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.’. In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation costs the NHS about between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. More than half of over-65s suffer from cataracts, which are cloudy patches in the lens that make vision blurred or misty. Sight can be restored in a simple 45-minute operation, with doctors using ultrasound waves to break up the cataract. . Most hospitals charge patients between £700 and £1,000 per eye for cataract treatment and say the money is spent on improving services. But this rises to £2,552 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and £2,700 at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent. Several trusts actively encourage patients to ‘self-fund’. The University Hospital Southampton’s website informs patients that ‘surgery will be offered much sooner than the usual NHS wait’. It adds: ‘Our cataract choice service offers a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS, bringing private healthcare within the reach of many more people.’. Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset says its private cataract service will ‘help you get back to the things you love’. Patients at North Cumbria are offered free parking and a daily newspaper, while at Frimley Park they can choose from an ‘exclusive a la carte menu’, which includes whitebait and chicken goujons.","Half of hospitals are letting patients jump NHS queues for cataract surgery.

CLIFF,cnndm,3783ef06d42f795f34533caf346c2cb9d3c844dd,"A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in ""The Jinx,"" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of ""lying in wait"" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she ""was a witness to a crime."" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. ""At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,"" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is ""mildly autistic"" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism.",Robert Durst is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.

But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy.

Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto. The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' . Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' . High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! . 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.  .",Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola wore tight - fitting trousers against Porto. Daniel Craig wore a similar suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall.

'When I first saw the note, I was expecting it to be an angry letter from someone telling me not to park there. Instead, I got someone just totally brightening my day. My day could have been ruined but, because of this guy, it was the highlight of my day.' The note reads, in part:. I noticed you left your lights on. The battery will probably not have enough charge to start your vehicle. I left a blue extension cord on the fence and a battery charger beside the fence in the cardboard box. If you know how to hook it up, use it to start your car. What followed was a detailed explanation of how to use the equipment. 'Sure enough,' Derek recalled to the National Post, 'I looked over at the house my car was parked beside, and there was a blue extension cord plugged into an outlet behind the guy’s house with a battery charger right there beside it.' Derek was able to get his car started, but when he rang the good Samaritan's doorbell, there was no answer. So, Derek left his own note as a thank you for the kind gesture. . He later snapped a photo of the stranger's friendly note to post to Facebook, where it has now gone viral.

Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote. But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014. Gross domestic product may actually shrink if oil prices drop to below $50 per barrel, Kazakh officials have said.  .",Nursultan Nazarbayev has won 97 per cent of the vote in Kazakhstan.

CLIFF,cnndm,17c80ce62c082281957473d3e7b53e4c88a6203d,"It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .",Barcelona reached landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992.

CLIFF,cnndm,39816732fdc433c5d126feed54f8bb12867bb4e5,"The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April–11 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay. You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century. The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey – around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels – another military-medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery – a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle. The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

CLIFF,cnndm,476469ad322b867bebce7523324d060e97092a30,"I don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, ""This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,"" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's ""on television,"" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those ""golden rule"" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said ""some insulting and regrettable things,"" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should ""always choose to be respectful and take the high road."" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. ""I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,"" wrote ""Cait"" on Twitter. Said ""Shannon,"" also on Twittter, ""I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be."" ""Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,"" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to ""treat other people the way you would want them to treat you"" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable. So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. ""That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,"" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a ""slut."" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. ""Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,"" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. ""... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more."" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her ""pre-recorded track"" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, ""Do you know who I am?"" and ""You're about to find out who I am."" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. ""We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,"" she said on ""Good Morning America."" ""It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that."" And, she added, ""When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,"" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect?

The French winger, 32, has won four Bundesliga titles as well as a Champions League during his time with the German giants, but it could have all been different had a proposed move to the Bernabeu in 2009 gone through. Real wanted Ribery after he fell out with then-Bayern head coach Louis van Gaal, though he says he was convinced to stay after being sold on his importance by the club's elite. Franck Ribery was convinced to reject Real Madrid after being sold on his importance to Bayern Munich. He was told that he could be as vital to Bayern as Lionel Messi is to Barcelona. Ribery fell out with then-head coach Louis van Gaal and says Real were willing to pay for him. 'I had intensive talks with Uli Hoeness, who was still president back then, and chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge,' Ribery told Goal. 'They told me I should not go, how the club needed me, how I was as important for Bayern as Lionel Messi was for Barcelona. 'Real tried, they wanted me. I don't know what price Bayern wanted them to pay. In the end I am happy how it ended.' As well as enjoying the collective success with Bayern, Ribery also picked up UEFA awards after his performances during the Champions League-winning campaign in 2012/13.

Up next, Rockhold wants a title shot and a shot at MMA history in New York. Rockhold capped a brief and brilliant appearance in the cage with a rear naked choke at 2:32 of the second round and made Lyoto Machida tap to win a main event showdown between two of the top middleweights in UFC on Saturday night. Luke Rockhold beat Lyoto Machida by second-round submission in New Jersey. Rockhold celebrates his victory and now wants a shot at the middleweight title . 'I am the No 1 contender,' Rockhold said. 'I'm the best guy around.' Rockhold should be next in line for a pay-per-view title shot in the 185-pound division. With a dominant win over the 36-year-old Machida, he positioned himself to take on the winner of the UFC 187 fight next month between Chris Weidman and Vitor Belfort. Machida never put up much of a fight in his brief stint in the cage. Rockhold lost on his UFC debut in 2013, then rebounded with wins over Costas Philippou, Tim Boetsch, Michael Bisping. He won his third straight fight via submission and looked at his best at the Prudential Center. 'I did my part,' Rockhold said. 'Weidman, you're going to do your part. Let's take this across the way. Madison Square Garden, let's make history.' Rockhold was dominant from the first bell as he cruised to victory against Machida. Machida was marked up badly after the first round and didn't last long in the second session. MMA would have to become legalized in New York for that bout to happen. The Senate again approved a bill to legalize and regulate the combat sport that includes boxing, judo, wrestling and kickboxing. UFC remained hopeful that the assembly will finally approve the bill that would allow the promotion to stage a dream card in December at MSG. 'If it doesn't happen, it'll be crazy,' UFC President Dana White said. Jacare Souza, the No 1 ranked middleweight, made short work of Chris Camozzi in the co-main event.

But when Romero was injured, Camozzi stepped in on short notice - and a shorter fight.

Machida-Rockhold and Souza-Romero would have been a Final Four showcase of the best of the UFC middleweight contenders.

Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double. Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday. Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox. Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle. The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes.

Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell. The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go.

CLIFF,cnndm,ec35ca922f2f717d417c685c3b5f5c7f64ca4867,"Mad Men star Jon Hamm's secret college bullying shame has been exposed by court documents unearthed from the actor's time at the University of Texas at Austin. According to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by Star magazine, the 44-year-old Golden Globe winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong. The documents claim that Hamm, 44, was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic November 1990 initiation, but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom. Scroll down for video . College student: Jon Hamm is pictured here in the University of Texas at Austin yearbook for 1990 (left) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the Sigma Nu fraternity. The actor is pictured (right) this week. According to the explosive court documents, Hamm was in his sophomore year at UT-Austin when a prospective 21-year-old pledge was called to the Sigma Nu house at 2.30am. When he got there, according to Travis County Court documents, Hamm - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him, 'It's going to be a long night!' The unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. The alleged victim told police that Hamm and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear, 'pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion', causing 'great pain'. The pledged then claimed that Hamm led him to a basement 'Pit' where he slammed the junior's face into the ground while he was doing push-ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight. Shockingly, after this, Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, but instead made him blow them out. Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21-year-old pledge and beat him with a paddle. At the end of the vicious hazing ritual, the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the 'Party Room' where Hamm 'hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room'. Allegedly not content with this, Hamm then went onto to break into another potential pledge's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation. However, the morning after, the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him 'hiding in a closet at his apartment, his buttocks and legs black with brusises.' Despit pleading with his mother not to go public, saying 'They'll come kill me!', she reported the incident to the police. High school senior: These pictures of Jon Hamm are from 1989, the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin. Early career:  Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Huge hit: Man Men and the character of Don Draper has given Jon Hamm his biggest role to date - winning a Golden Globe for his work on the AMC series. Eight warrants were issued for Hamm and seven other frat members, which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident. Three members of Sigma Nu were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and Hamm was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991. In the wake of the hazing incident, the Sigma Nu fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge's mother made her son's alleged assault public by going to the police. . In 1990, the AP reported that Sigma NU would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were 'physically and psychologically attacked'. The-then national president of Sigma Nu, James Cherry, said that he was revoking the charter of its UT-Austin, saying, 'Basically, we're out of business on this campus'. 'But our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today.' A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Hazing incident: Following the alleged assault of the 21-year-old pledge, the Sigma Nu fraternity at UT-Austin (pictured) was shut down . Recently, the Mad Men star has admitted that playing the complex role of Don Draper has taken its toll. In an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days, Hamm opened up about the effect that playing Madison Avenue ad man Don Draper had on his psyche. The 44-year-old star told Variety: 'Playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties, it’s not fun to live in this guy’s headspace year after year.' He added: 'People ask, ""What’s the difference between you and Don?"" Look, I drink, I get drunk. I’m not immune to that,. 'And (creator) Matt (Weiner) will tell you, the darkness in Don has not abated, it’s gotten worse year after year. It’s relentless. And it can be hard on you as a person. I love coming to work; I love the people I work with. But it’s been rough.' As he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark, brooding, alcoholic womanizing character, Jon revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona.",The 44 - year - old Mad Men star was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity at the University of Texas at Austin in 1990.

Playing Jordan Henderson as a wing back instead of in his normal central midfield position was an idea that went spectacularly wrong for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. . The England star, who has taken over the captain’s armband in the absence of Steven Gerrard, gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes as he struggled to handle the role at Arsenal. . Jordan Henderson (left) toiled as a wing back in Liverpool's defeat against Arsenal and lost the ball 23 times. Henderson, usually a central midfielder, has not given the ball away as much all season for Liverpool. There hasn’t been a single one of his previous 29 Premier League appearances this season in which he’s lost possession more. 2. John O’Shea has clearly learned the canny defender’s art of letting his brain do all the running. The theory is if you get in the right position in the first place, you don’t have to chase to recover. In 90 minutes of helping Sunderland keep a clean sheet against Newcastle, the Ireland international logged just 11.9 metres at sprint speed on the EA Sports performance data. It clearly works for him – he’ll be 34 at the end of this month but remains the sole Premier League outfield player to have appeared in every minute of every game in all competitions for his club this season. . John O'Shea only sprinted 11.9 metres during his impressive display in Sunderland's 1-0 win over Newcastle. O'Shea (third left) celebrated Sunderland's win with Costel Pantilimon when the final whistle was blown. For good measure he’s also completed the full 90 minutes of all five European Championship qualifiers for the Republic. 3. Steven Caulker’s form has suffered from playing with too many different partners at QPR but there are signs the former Spurs and Cardiff centre half is returning to his best. . The 23-year-old was a towering figure as a West Brom side led by the powerful figure of substitute Victor Anichebe fought to recover from being three goals down at half-time. . Steven Caulker (right) wins a header against West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye. Caulker made 20 clearances – as many as the rest of the Rangers back four put together – and more than any other Premier League defender all weekend. 4. Chelsea need have few fears if Diego Costa’s hamstring problems mean they have to rely on Loic Remy for goals in the last eight games of the season. . The France international’s tap-in from Eden Hazard’s pass for the winner against Stoke was his fifth Premier League goal of the season from just 456 minutes on the pitch. Loic Remy (centre) scored Chelsea's winner in their 2-1 victory over Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Remy could be vital to Chelsea as they look to win the Premier League title after Diego Costa went off injured. That’s a goal every 91 minutes – actually a better ratio than Costa whose 19 Premier League goals have come at the rate of one every 103 minutes. 5. Burnley boss Sean Dyche has talked about stability all season and continues to practise what he preaches. . He picked an unchanged side for the 16th time this season for the home clash with Tottenham and was rewarded with a valuable point. . Sean Dyche selected an unchanged side for the 16th time as Burnley drew 0-0 with Tottenham on Sunday. That’s more than double the number of times any other club has kept the same starting XI – next highest is Leicester with seven. 6. Kasper Schmeichel looked to have lost his first-team place at Leicester a few weeks ago following the arrival from Chelsea of veteran Mark Schwarzer. . But the 28-year-old son of Manchester United legend Peter returned for the 4-3 defeat at Tottenham just before the international break, and justified Nigel Pearson’s decision to keep him in the side with a brilliant display in the 2-1 win over West Ham. . Kasper Schmeichel made a string of outstanding stops as Leicester beat West Ham 2-1.

Matt Grimes (right) impressed in his substitute appearance for Swansea in the 3-1 win against Hull . It wasn’t a bad little cameo, either. Swansea scored their third in the 3-1 win over Hull barely a minute after Grimes came on. 8. Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer left striker Jordan Rhodes out of his starting side for the 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final at Liverpool – but surely can’t drop him again for Wednesday’s replay. . The 25-year-old Scotland international is in the best scoring form of even his prolific career after netting the second of the 3-0 win at Leeds. It was his eighth goal in the last 12 games for Blackburn and took his total for the season to 17 from 35 Championship starts.

Boyhood Hearts fan Jason Holt admitted he was upset at missing out on the celebrations when his old club clinched top spot in the Scottish Championship a few weeks ago. . But the midfielder who moved to Sheffield United in January might yet be able to open some bubbly with his new club after scoring in the 2-0 derby win at Barnsley. . It was the 22-year-old's third in as many games and gave Nigel Clough’s side a seven-point cushion for a place in the League One play-off zone. Midfielder Jason Holt (left) is proving important to Sheffield United's hopes of going up a division. John Akinde celebrates scoring for Barnet, where he has found the net 30 times in the league this season. 10.

The striker’s move never worked out – but seven years and nine clubs later he’s setting records again and this time for much better reasons. .

CLIFF,cnndm,f7e0de384a8e52cafaa3161f71a979d269fe12fe,"The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but ""inadvertently"" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. ""It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used,"" Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an ""excusable homicide."" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. ""We're holding up all right at this point,"" Andre Harris said. ""We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation."" How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. ""However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO,"" the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies. CNN's Jason Morris and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.",Eric Harris' brother says no type of force should have been used.

Struck again: Christian Englander, 30, has thrown a banana peel at a black man for the second time in one week. He was arrested on Monday for hurling one at Dave Chappelle. On Thursday he struck again at a bar. Not amused: Santa Fe police say a man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a show in New Mexico Monday, hitting in the comedian in the leg. Here Chappelle performs last summer. Chappelle was performing a comedy routine at the Lensic theater in Santa Fe when a banana peel struck him . According to Englander, his first attack came after Chappelle mocked his friend's name 'Johnny Appleseed'. . Police said the 30-year-old, from Santa Fe, appeared to be drunk as he sat near the stage. . According to TMZ, Englander thought Chappelle's quips were racist, so he decided to throw the peel, which he had in his pocket. . He had allegedly eaten the banana at a convenience store before the show, and washed it down with a shot of the alcoholic beverage 99 Bananas. After the attack, he was escorted out of the venue. On Thursday, he became embroiled in a fight with a man called Jay Wills, Oregon Live reports.

In a 2013 gig in Hartford, Connecticut, Chappelle shut down his act after 10 minutes because of heckling. Known for his sharp commentary on race relations in America, Chappelle has gradually resumed his stand-up career in the past two years, making a long-awaited return after abruptly abandoning a popular Comedy Central show in 2005. Court documents indicate that following his arrest Monday night, Christian Englander 'appeared unapologetic and made several statements that appeared to be racially motivated.’. A criminal complaint cited by the Albuquerque Journal states that while smiling and laughing, Englander said: 'maybe I should have handed you [Chappelle] the banana instead.' Chappelle told police it seemed that his attacker was not remorseful and that the banana toss was 'racially motivated,' according to the complaint. The 41-year-old comedian indicated that he wanted to press charges against Englander.

The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh and marveled at the fact that someone would carry a banana peel in their pocket. ‘Why didn't he throw a good banana at me? Just the brown peel? Where's the rest of it? I am actually offended by the poor quality of the banana. It was brown, man,’ he was quoted as saying by the news blog NewsCastic. . But the pugnacious performer said he was not surprised that it happened to him. ‘I wish I could be, “I can't believe this is happening,” but in all honestly, I've been expecting that banana for many years,’ Chappelle told the crowd. ‘I just didn't know tonight was going to be the night.' The former Comedy Central star also used the incident to gently rib the popular comedy duo Key and Peele, who currently have a sketch show on the cable network. ‘Key and Peele probably did that s***,’ he joked, referring to the banana throw. ‘Key and Banana Peel.’. Chappelle is expected to carry on his comedy tour, performing a show in El Paso, Texas, Tuesday night.   .

Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. . 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. . Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected. Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. . Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60.  .","Justus Howell was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois.",Pegasus,val,correct,

Ahead of the trip to the Kassam Stadium, Wasps' hunt for an automatic European Rugby Champions Cup spot next season had stuttered after winning just one of their previous five fixtures in all competitions. However, they claimed a 40-13 win over Welsh with tries from Varndell, Ashley Johnson, Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua. Tom Varndell crosses for one of his three tries as Wasps ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium. It was far from plain sailing for Wasps, though as the Exiles, whose defeat to Bath last time out confirmed that they will finish bottom of the table, trailed 12-5 at half-time after Opeti Fonua bundled over after the first two of Varndell's tries. But Johnson dotted down and Varndell added his third before Tagicakibau secured the bonus point for Wasps, with Alapati Leiua getting in on the act with the last play of the game. Chris Elder scored Welsh's second try of the match in the second period. Wasps got off to a fast start at the Kassam as they went 12 points clear after as many minutes. The visitors found the tryline after only four minutes as Varndell broke down the right flank and scored in the corner, veteran fly-half Andy Goode converting well from a tight angle. Welsh then went down to 14 men eight minutes later when Koree Britton was sent to the sin bin for pulling down a maul and Wasps instantly capitalised as Varndell grabbed his second try. Seb Stegmann is tackled by Carlo Festuccia as the exiles put up a fight, but faded away again. Alapati Leiua breaks away to score a late try as Wasps pulled away in the closing stages . The Exiles crept back into the game, though, keeping the pressure on Wasps' defence and Fonua forced his way through to make it 12-5, Tristan Roberts kicking the conversion side. Welsh started the second half well and Roberts made amends for his earlier miss as he calmly kicked a penalty between the posts to reduce the arrears even further. But Wasps soon began to dominate and a lineout close to the try-line was bundled over by Johnson in his first start as hooker. Then a swift break down the right saw Varndell free to run back around the Welsh defence and score under the posts for his hat-trick. Elder scored a try out of nowhere four minutes later for the Exiles on his Aviva Premiership debut, as he found space on the left wing to touch down in the corner. Wasps instantly replied though as Tagicakibau finished a great run through the centre by reaching for the line. And the game ended on a high for Wasps as Leiua finished the scoring with a darting run through the middle. James Cannon wins a line-out for Wasps ahead of London Welsh's Matt Corker as Wasps recovered their form. Andy Goode adds extras as Wasps renewed their chase for a European Champions Cup place.  .","Wasps ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium.

Sagna's acrimonious departure from Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of last season left many Gunners fans dismayed at a perceived lack of loyalty from the defender.

'I see a lot of comments from fans saying I should have stayed at Arsenal but if I had to do it again, if I had to come back and sign for City, I would have done it again,' Sagna told the Manchester Evening News. 'I'm happy because I came to the champions.' Sagna departed the Emirates on the back of an FA Cup triumph but arrived at City with the club having won the Premier League. A year later, Arsenal are gearing up to defend their trophy against Aston Villa in the final at Wembley but City's Premier League title will almost certainly be claimed by Chelsea.

Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. . Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season. Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012. Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott. Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. . Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final. Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year. 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. . Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge. 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it.

The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. . Scroll down for video . A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs. Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. . A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_. While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland.  . The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. . 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.'

CLIFF,cnndm,8012ab9261e117ab47a2759b3c0b628f2a007a82,"According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, ""(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia."" The Columbia team concluded that ""The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking."" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, ""We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students."" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that ""the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent."" ""Actionable"" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers ""true."" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were ""of or concerning"" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is ""concerning"" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about ""a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue."" If I said, ""The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals"" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the ""small group"" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are ""between jobs,"" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.","Danny Cevallos: UVA, Phi Kappa Psi, other fraternities can't sue for defamation.

Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury. Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season. Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. . One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas. Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’. Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday. Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off. Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’.",Jordon Ibe is set to sign a new long - term deal at Liverpool.

The venerable club in Baron’s Court will host Britain’s biggest home tie in three decades from July 17-19, after agreement was reached between its management and the Lawn Tennis Association today. British Captain Leon Smith and his lead player had made it clear that they wanted to take on the strong French team on grass, as it would appear to give them fewer selection options from their rich resources. Andy Murray in action last year at the Queen's Club, which will host the Davis Cup quarter final against France. Murray celebrates winning at Queen's in 2013 - one of three triumphs he has had at the tournament. Tickets go on sale on May 27 and the match is sure to sell out quickly with the likely capacity of the one court used being around 7,000, as it is for the AEGON Championships, which takes place two weeks before Wimbledon. The All England Club’s overworked show courts, plus the redevelopment work being done there, meant that SW19 was never an option only five days after the Championships finish. The fixture means a bumper helping of six weeks’ top level grass court tennis in the UK this summer, a far cry from 20 years ago when some believed the sport’s one organic surface might even disappear. This time there will be three weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon, so by the time GB take on France for a place in the World Group semi-finals all the players will be perfectly attuned to the grass. The court at Queen’s is at least the equal of Wimbledon in terms of quality, and the atmosphere will be very different from the usually staid one that accompanies the principle warm-up event for the big fortnight. Thanks to Murray, GB and France look well-matched and it could well depend on who wins the doubles rubber on the Saturday. France has seven players in the world’s singles top 50, although some have been affected by injuries this season. However, they will be encouraged by the recent comeback of Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who is their best grass court exponent and looking in decent form after overcoming arm problems.

The figure represents $1 million for each of the 51 additional years that John Bieniewicz, 44, could have lived, according to the lawsuit in Wayne County court. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland, the representative of her husband's estate, is suing Bassel Saad, along with another man who controlled the team and the soccer league. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland (pictured left with her late husband) has filed a $51 million lawsuit against Bassel Saad (right) who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. Bieniewicz died after Saad punched him in the head just moments before Saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in Livonia. Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other, and performed CPR which failed to work. . 'We hope this lawsuit sends a message that when you commit uncivilized acts in a civilized world there are consequences, even beyond the criminal realm,' said attorney James Acho, who had known Bieniewicz since childhood. Cyril Hall, Saad's attorney in the criminal case, said Friday that the lawsuit surprises him. 'Bassel Saad is not an individual of wealth. He was a mechanic,' Hall said. Behind bars: Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from a telephone listing for the soccer league. Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. . He expressed remorse in court and said he prays for the Bieniewicz family. The lawsuit also names the Michigan United Soccer League, which is accused of allowing Saad to play despite his reputation as a violent player. Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad. 'I speak for his dozens of buddies, many of whom go back to our days at Catholic Central High, and we want justice for his family,' said Acho, who is handling the case with co-counsel Karen Daley. . In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded no contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation.

A James Forrest strike and Stefan Johansen’s penalty were enough to see off a spirited challenge by the bottom side as Celtic moved eight points clear of Aberdeen. But although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win, Deila felt their cause wasn’t helped by the state of the Paisley surface. And he believes Scottish football will struggle to develop top players if there isn’t a drastic improvement in our pitches. Celtic manager Ronny Deila was impressed with his side's performance against St Mirren on Friday night. ‘It was a tough game, St Mirren were well organised and played very deep,’ he said. ‘They fought really hard and it was difficult to break them down. We had to be patient. The pitch was better than some others we’ve played on. But the pitches in Scotland are terrible. ‘If you want to develop players and get passing football, it’s difficult when the ball is bouncing all the time. It’s much easier for the other teams to just sit behind the ball and try to break down our play. ‘It’s better to play on an artificial surface than this. If they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality, it’s totally different and much closer to European standards. James Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren. ‘If we are going to develop good young players, you need a good surface to play and train on. If not, you get fighters. If you want skills and technique, play on better surfaces. ‘They are much better in Norway. Sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they don’t train there and there aren’t other teams playing on them. And we play in the summer. That’s the biggest thing. The pitch here might not look so bad but try to play on it.’. TV pictures showed Leigh Griffiths eating a chocolate biscuit while sitting on the bench. But Deila, a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning, laughed it off. ‘I think it was a carbo biscuit which is totally different! I’ll have to check his weight tomorrow.’. Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory. Goalscorer Johansen believes there’s no stopping Celtic as they close in on a treble. ‘It looks great for us now,’ he said. ‘I don’t think we’re unbeatable but there is a huge confidence in the team. ‘We are starting to look fitter and have much more of the ball because we’re playing with a higher tempo. That’s the way the manager wants us to play. I said in the beginning when people were asking questions I was confident he would be a great and it’s starting to look that way.’. Saints boss Gary Teale felt there were positives in defeat but wasn’t happy about the handball awarded against Viktor Genev for Celtic’s penalty. ‘Was it ball to hand or hand to ball?

The Tractor Boys, who have now lost four of their last five away games, were caught cold by goals in the opening 30 minutes by Huddersfield strike pair Nahki Wells and James Vaughan.

In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire ""homegrown"" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.",Al Qaeda confirms two of its leaders were killed in CIA drone strikes in January.

CLIFF,cnndm,b8803c87ad83ffc194b4161bfcdd6e9584e7d653,"Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for ""lost"" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the ""holiday"" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the ""mistake"" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut. Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the ""war on women"" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious ""war on women"" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The ""war on women"" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the ""war on women"" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative ""solution"" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.","Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, a fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups.",Pegasus,val,correct,

Chris Lewis, 68, has brought the unusual court case against 48-year-old former wife Nicola over the child he helped raise as his own for 17 years. In court documents he claims Mrs Lewis had sex with another man only a few months into their marriage, but did not tell him. She had a child – Charlie, now 19 – as a result but led him to believe the boy was his, he argues. Suing ex-wife: Chris Lewis, 68 (left) has accused his former partner Nicola, 48 (right) of duping him about the paternity of her son Charlie. DNA tests now prove that Charlie is not his biological son, he says, and as a result of the deception he suffered loss and damages – and wants compensation totalling £322,400. The claim, made in documents before the High Court in London, says that the pair married in October 1994 and that Mrs Lewis gave birth to Charlie in March 1996. The couple separated in May 1999. Although Charlie subsequently lived with his mother, Mr Lewis says he ‘would see him regularly and make financial contributions towards his maintenance and advancement’. He claims that his ex-wife continued to lead him to believe that he was the boy’s biological father and he was recorded as such on the birth certificate. He was discussed as being the father in the course of the couple’s divorce, with Mrs Lewis signing ‘statements of truth maintaining that was the case’. Everything changed in April 2013, however, shortly after Charlie’s 17th birthday, when both he and Mr Lewis had DNA tests. They are said to have proven beyond doubt that Mr Lewis was not the boy’s father. The court documents claim that Mrs Lewis’s repeated assertions that her ex-husband was the father of her child ‘were made fraudulently’ with her ‘knowing them to be false or not caring whether they were true or false’. Mr Lewis’s lawyers say that Mrs Lewis ‘had sexual intercourse with David Alderson or an unknown person which resulted in the conception of Charlie in or around May or June 1995’. High-profile contract: Mr Lewis's company, Chris Lewis Media, provided coverage of the Equestrian events at the London Olympics and the TV producer brought Charlie to the venue during the games. They add: ‘On no occasion during the parties’ marriage did Mrs Lewis inform Mr Lewis that she had had sexual intercourse with another person/persons. ‘She knew that Mr Lewis was not the biological father of Charlie, or was reckless as to whether he was the biological father, or did not believe he was the biological father. ‘By reason of her deceit and misrepresentations, Mr Lewis has suffered loss and damage, and claims damages plus interest.’. Mr Lewis was for decades one of the BBC’s leading sports producers, masterminding footage of every Olympic Games since 1972 as well as working on coverage of ten football World Cups. Since leaving the BBC in 2006, he has specialised in equestrian sports. He is understood to have taken Charlie to equestrian events at the London 2012 Olympics, which his TV company Chris Lewis Media was filming, a few months before he discovered he was not the boy’s father. Speaking about the court case, Mr Lewis, of Twickenham, South West London, said: ‘It’s been a very hurtful time for all parties.’. Mrs Lewis lives in a £1.2million house in Shepperton, Surrey, and is a company director of a fireplace shop. She told the Daily Mail last night: ‘I haven’t even looked at the document from court, and I can’t say anything because it’s in the hands of my solicitors.’. David Alderson, 59, of Cobham, Surrey, who is alleged to be a former lover of Mrs Lewis and the possible father of her child, was unavailable for comment last night. .","Chris Lewis, 68, has brought unusual court case against former wife Nicola.

The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'. But the Prime Minister hailed today as 'money-back Monday' - with a raft of tax changes coming into force putting more cash in voters' wallets. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls, speaking in Leeds this morning, ramped up his attack on the Tories today - claiming that David Cameron was planning a VAT increase and cuts to the top rate of tax. Mr Cameron has claimed that Labour are planning to increase taxes by £3,028 on 'every working family'. . But, speaking in Leeds this morning, Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke hit back with an accusation that Labour has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. . They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'  Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Mr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires. 'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and £1,100 a year worse-off? 'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards? 'How can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the Tories are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five?' Mr Balls said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning £1 million a year £340,000 over the course of the next Parliament, while someone with income of £5 million would get a total tax cut of £1.94 million over the five-year period. Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut £10 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children £1,440 over four years. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg meets supporters at the Grove Pub while out campaigning in Surbiton, London. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said. However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than £3,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago. Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.' Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over £150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes. Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost £400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to £12,500. . By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just £37 to taxpayers. 'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West. 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate. Labour has already failed to commit the £8 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.' Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton. Mr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... 'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament. 'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal. On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition. Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News. 'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.' Mr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'","Labour ramp up attack on the Tories on the eighth day of campaigning.

Fire starter: Hungry Leo almost burned down his owner's home  as he hunted for his dog treats. The blaze was started after the Staffordshire-Boxer cross was believed to have knocked one of the cooker knobs, switching on the hob.

Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title. CHENNAI SUPER KINGS. The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final. £1,740,000 - Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. . 3325 - runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119 - wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60 - matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8 - teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 -  English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS. The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. . They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team. KINGS XI PUNJAB. After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title. KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS. The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League. MUMBAI INDIANS. The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood.

RAJASTHAN ROYALS. Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan. Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals. ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE. Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (£1.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack.

SUNRISERS HYDERABAD. The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL.

Local officials say they have now launched an investigation into how the water from the well, which cost £1,000 to build, became so polluted. Locals said they could smell  petrol when the water surfaced, and blame the pollution on a leak from a local gas petrol station, a claim which the owner denies. However, when Chinese officials investigated, they said they could find no trace of a spillage, leading some people to theorise that the villagers could have struck oil. However this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits only occur between 750 and 4,500m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. Tuo Zhijun, a villager in Ansai, said: 'Who knew when we turned on the pump, once the water was seeping through, everyone could smell gas and see oil slick.'

After drawing the first fresh water out of their new well, the villagers discovered they were able to set it on fire because it was so polluted. Local officials do not yet know exactly what substance is in the water, though they say they are conducting a specific investigation to discover the cause. ‘We suspect that there was an oil leak from a petrol station not far from here.’ . However, Li Jianhua, the manager of the petrol station, refuted these claims, saying: ‘The authorities have already examined the place and nothing was wrong. .

But Judy Murray has already wasted no time in revealing she simply ‘can’t wait to be a granny’. However, the tennis coach, who helped propel Andy, 27, and his brother, Jamie, 29, to sporting success, has a couple of caveats – he has to get the French Open and Wimbledon out of the way first. Mrs Murray, 55, who has carved out her own star status after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing last year, also said she would be a ‘very active granny’ and in the same way she coached her sons, she already has plans to introduce her grandchildren to tennis.

Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution.

Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his ‘manifestly ill-founded’ case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. . This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the £40,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: ‘This is a shocking example of Labour’s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.’. Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. . He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius’s claim that extradition breached his human rights was ‘inadmissible’. They added: ‘The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.’ .","Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him. 52 - year - old is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, including two murders. spun out legal battle by insisting he was mentally ill.",Pegasus,val,['intrinsic-predicate'],['spun']
CLIFF,cnndm,a88286f286c480c3c773b89aa6fa26710a74f291,"Universal's ""Furious 7"" is about to make history.""Furious 7"" — the final film from the late Paul Walker — is expected to gross $115 million or more when opening at the North American box office this weekend, the top showing ever for an April title, not accounting for inflation.Domestically, it is getting the widest release in Universal's history with a theater count of roughly 4,003 (including Imax locations), eclipsing ""Despicable Me 2"" (3,956). Anything north of 4,000 is usually reserved for summer tentpoles and year-end titles. Overseas, the movie is also poised to do massive business, putting its global debut north of $250 million. ""Furious 7"" is opening day-and-date around the world on 10,500 screens in 63 territories, save for a few major markets including China, Russia and Japan. THR: 'Furious 7' scores Thailand release despite Tony Jaa contract dispute. The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" which debuted to $95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. ""Furious 7"" is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And if it beats the $121.9 million launch of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1"" in November 2014, it will mark the largest three-day opening since ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" ($158 million) in November 2013. The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest, due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker's death. The last film,"" Fast & Furious 6,"" debuted to a franchise-best $117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012, including $97.4 million for the three days, on its way to grossing $788.7 million worldwide. Universal intended to open ""Furious 7"" on July 11, 2014, but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus. After director James Wan, writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script, production resumed in April 2014. THR: Studio profitability report - Who's up and who's down. CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker's detective character, Brian O'Conner, with Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, used as stand-ins. ""Furious 7"" pits Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and crew (which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson, among others, as well as Walker) against Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, out for revenge after the death of his brother. ""Furious 7"" is expected to usher in a string of mega-openings at the box office this year. Disney and Marvel's ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" set to open May 1, hasn't come on tracking yet, but some forecasters are already suggesting it could score the top opening of all time domestically, eclipsing the record-breaking start of ""The Avengers"" ($207 million) in 2012.
