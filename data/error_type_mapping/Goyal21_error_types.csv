Goyal’21,cnndm,c811d9ae87c9bfbf31481bf8a916dc0b8e083a60,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- There was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed : The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus . The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it . The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students . That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called `` Jackie , '' especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out . The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012 , and Jackie told the university about it the next spring . She started telling her story very publicly , including at a `` take back the night '' rally . But Charlottesville police did n't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014 , in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face . When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident . In both cases , police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case . But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie 's . Rolling Stone 's story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims . Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus . They 'd call it a `` bad experience . '' Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being `` rapey '' and for using date-rape drugs . That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman 's outfit . And if a woman did report her rape , some women complained that the internal process did n't seem worth it if their abuser would n't be kicked out of school . Rolling Stone had a line in its original story : `` UVA 's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams . And yet paradoxically , not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault . '' After the article published , UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined , so it 's unclear what it means . When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone 's website , that was lost . `` You lose a lot of other people 's voices who were in that article , '' said Sarah Roderick , a survivor and UVA student , `` and a lot of good things that could have come about . Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus '' -- and , she added , across the nationo . Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation , there 's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit . The attorney who filed the suit , James Marsh , told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he 's representing , making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice . When the Columbia Journalism School 's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up , it really boils down to this : The mistake could have been avoided if the writer , Sabrina Rubin Erdely , had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night . They 'd later tell other media outlets , including CNN , that they remembered a very different story . Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag . And all three say they would have talked if they 'd been called . Ryan Duffin , one of the trio , said he felt deceived by Jackie , but he also pointed out that Erdely 's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident , and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost . `` Had she gotten in direct contact with us , it probably would n't have been printed , at least in that way , '' he said . `` A lot of the article was still based in truth , but the focal point would have been different . '' It might have been less dramatic , but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus . `` I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that 's not very common , '' Roderick said . '' ... And I wonder if it would have been different if -LRB- it dealt -RRB- with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people . I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through . Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through . Now it 's like , ` If I was n't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention . ' It 's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm . '' Before the report came out , Abraham Axler , the student body president , said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide . But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress . `` I do feel like there 's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward . If you come forward and share your story , if you do n't have the date right , every detail down , you 'll think , ` I 'm going to be accused of being a liar . It 's easier for me to keep it to myself , ' '' Roderick said . `` There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university 's performance , '' said Steve Coll , dean of the Columbia School of Journalism . `` Rolling Stone teed that subject up . I would n't say that everything about Rolling Stone 's treatment of that subject was perfect , but it certainly does n't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie 's narrative .

O'Malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month .

Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force -LRB- ASDF -RRB- had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

The vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August . But not everyone escaped . ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive . Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot . But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves . In its fourth edition of `` Dabiq , '' the ISIS online magazine , an article titled `` The revival of slavery before the hour , '' outlines the group 's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis . `` One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -LRB- infidels -RRB- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah , '' the article reads . We 're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and can not be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan , 19 , was neither of those things . `` They separated all of us , '' she says . `` They dragged us away by our hair . They took married women , young ones . The youngest with us was just 10 . We were all crying . `` They said we are going to marry you off , you will forget your family . '' ISIS : Enslaving , having sex with ` unbelieving ' women , girls is OK . For the first week , Hanan was held with 50 others , regularly beaten and threatened with torture , and fed just a bowl of rice . The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse , where hundreds of girls and women were held . `` They would line about 50 of us up at a time , in rows of 10 . They would say do n't move , do n't cry or we will beat you . The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased , '' she recalls . She was eventually chosen , part of a group of 25 . From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village . ` Treated like cattle ' : Yazidi women sold , raped , enslaved by ISIS . Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves . `` They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months . She was wearing the black niqab . They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her , '' Hanan says . `` The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me , they cuffed me and raped me .

I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight , '' she tells me . `` They caught the last two girls . '' They ran , and somehow evaded capture . Four hours later they were out of ISIS territory . `` If I just see someone with a beard I start shaking , '' Hanan says .

'' Those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean 's pop masterpiece `` American Pie . '' It 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8 1/2 minute allegory , which millions of Americans know by heart , is 44 years old . All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as `` Bye , Bye , Miss American Pie . '' There is no real way to categorize McLean 's `` American Pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock . On Tuesday , Christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . McLean was a paperboy when , on February 3 , 1959 , he saw that Buddy Holly , Ritchie Valens and J.P. `` The Big Bopper '' Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake , Iowa . `` The next day I went to school in shock and guess what ? '' McLean recalled . `` Nobody cared . Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 . '' By cathartically writing `` American Pie , '' McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever . Having recorded his first album , `` Tapestry , '' in 1969 , in Berkeley , California , during the student riots , McLean , a native New Yorker , became a kind of weather vane for what he called the `` generation lost in space . '' When his cultural anthem `` American Pie '' was released in November 1971 , it replaced Bob Dylan 's `` The Times They Are A Changin '' as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade . It 's important to think of `` American Pie '' as one would of Henry Longfellow 's `` Evangeline '' or Johnny Mercer 's `` Moon River '' -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection , blues valentine , and youthful protest rolled into one . There is magic brewing in the music and words of `` American Pie , '' for McLean 's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream , like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel `` On the Road . '' Don McLean : Buddy Holly , rest in peace . Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers , McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s , when `` American Pie '' topped the Billboard charts , and has never shed the cape . Wandering far and wide , singing `` American Pie '' at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England , at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley , McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times . Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure . When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing `` and they were singing '' everybody spontaneously joins in with the `` Bye , Bye '' chorus . Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening . What makes `` American Pie '' so unusual is that it is n't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman , which , like a sacred river , keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere . When `` American Pie '' suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it 's almost impossible not to sing along . Like `` Danny Boy '' or `` Streets of Laredo '' or `` Shenandoah , '' it 's eternal . With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll , river levees and nursery rhymes , the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes . After all these years , `` American Pie '' still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss . The song is alive and joyful , yet fretful about a world gone wrong . It is a song that will never die . A reverie for the ages . There is a jump to the chorus , which forces the mind to relive the '50s , '60s and '70s , to troll through the back pages of our lives while , like a traditional Irish folksong , it reminds us of fate . While McLean , the muse , has rightfully not tried to interpret `` American Pie , '' it 's fair to surmise that `` the king '' is Elvis Presley , `` Helter Skelter '' refers to the Charles Manson murders , the `` jester on the sidelines in a cast '' is Bob Dylan , and `` Jack Flash '' the Rolling Stones . But who knows ? The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations . As a literary artifact of the early 1970s , there is n't anything to compare to `` American Pie . '' Normally , I do n't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents , for that matter . But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose `` American Pie '' as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition 's importance as an enduring piece of pop art . The other four were `` Over the Rainbow '' -LRB- by Harold Arlen and E.Y `` Yip '' Harburg -RRB- , `` White Christmas '' -LRB- by Irving Berlin -RRB- , `` This Land is Your Land '' -LRB- by Woody Guthrie -RRB- and `` Respect '' -LRB- by Otis Redding -RRB- .

'' `` Tonight , the Senate is voting to retire the outdated , inefficiency-rewarding , common sense-defying Medicare reimbursement system , '' said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon , the top Democrat on the Finance Committee just before the final vote . The House approved the same bill overwhelmingly more than two weeks ago and President Barack Obama is expected to sign it . Senate passage came just hours before cuts to physicians would have taken place since the last temporary `` doc fix '' had already expired . Some conservative senators , including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas , balked at the more than $ 200 billion price of the bill and pushed an amendment to have the costs offset . The bill , `` institutionalizes and expands Obamacare policies that harm patients and their doctors while adding roughly half a trillion dollars to our long-term debt within two decades , '' Cruz said in a statement . `` Any deal should be fully paid for and include significant and structural reforms to Medicare . '' But that amendment was defeated , as were several others from each party that came up for votes . Earlier , House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio warned the Senate not to change the bill . `` Unless the Senate passes the House-passed ` doc fix , ' significant cuts to physicians ' payments will begin tomorrow , '' Boehner said . `` We urge the Senate to approve the House-passed bill without delay . '' Cruz voted against the bill , as did Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida , another Republican running for president . GOP presidential contender Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted for the bill .",the issue of payments to medicare has been a thorny issue for years.,val,['intrinsic-NP'],[['medicare (medicare providers)']]

His comments to The New York Times , published on Sunday , come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran . Tehran agreed to halt the country 's nuclear ambitions , and in exchange , Western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the Iran 's economy . Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu 's stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and does n't `` have the luxury of testing these propositions '' in the deal . `` But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge , and that they can deter any potential future attacks , but what I 'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood , including Iran , a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state , that we would stand by them , '' Obama said . That , he said , should be `` sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table , '' he said . The framework negotiators announced last week would see Iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060 , limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections . The talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until June 30 . But Netanyahu and Republican critics in Congress have complained that Iran wo n't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country 's leadership is n't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as Obama says they are . Obama said even if Iran ca n't be trusted , there 's still a case to be made for the deal . `` In fact , you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us , all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they 're doing and that , for a long period of time , we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon , '' Obama said .","israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu of the deal says iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000.",test,['intrinsic-NP'],[['of the deal']]

He is , of course , the Iranian foreign minister . He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . And he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning . `` Long live Zarif , '' crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . You may well have read that he is `` polished '' and , unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues , `` jovial . '' An Internet search for `` Mohammad Javad Zarif '' and `` jovial '' yields thousands of results . He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known . Here are six : . In September 2013 , Zarif tweeted `` Happy Rosh Hashanah , '' referring to the Jewish New Year . That prompted Christine Pelosi , the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own : `` Thanks . The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran 's Holocaust denial , sir . '' And , perhaps to her surprise , Pelosi got a response . `` Iran never denied it , '' Zarif tweeted back . `` The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . Happy New Year . '' The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad 's successor , Hassan Rouhami . His foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that `` due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the United States . '' That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran , which began in 1977 , and during the Iranian Revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . Zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988 . Both of his children were born in the United States . The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry , which Zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . The first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran , says Zarif was `` born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959 . '' Later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as January 8 , 1960 . And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . Whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , Kerry , who is 71 . The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation , a charitable organization . The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions . But last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government , did not mention Zarif 's name . Early in the Iranian Revolution , Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco . The aim , says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif 's memoirs , titled `` Mr. Ambassador '' -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic . Later , the website says , Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations . In response , the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job . In fact , he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland .",u.s. secretary of state john kerry says the iranian foreign minister is a foreign minister.,val,['intrinsic-predicate'],[['says the iranian foreign minister is a foreign minister']]

Goyal’21,cnndm,2b1b6a434b171e198413479aaba118f0cd20c843,"Durham , North Carolina -LRB- CNN -RRB- President Obama 's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country 's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick . Her confirmation , however , is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month . The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee 's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch 's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history . By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday , it 'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined . Lynch , currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York , cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8 , with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah , Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate . Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8 , after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier . Hundreds of miles from Washington , longtime residents of Durham , North Carolina , were beaming with pride . Lynch 's family moved to the city when she was a child . Her parents , married for 60 years , still live there . They watched the announcement on television . `` That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands , '' said Lynch 's father , the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch . `` I 've been in politics most of my life . I know that nothing is certain , and I know that nothing is easy . '' Lorenzo Lynch , 82 , is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s . He ran , unsuccessfully , for mayor of Durham in 1973 . For the next round of his daughter 's `` fight , '' he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter 's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee . `` I heard a lot at that hearing that I 've heard since childhood . That is the presupposition of the mindset , '' Lorenzo Lynch said . `` The dual system or the dual treatment . '' When asked to provide specific examples , Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison , a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham . `` I do n't want to think about the epidermis , but some people are thinking that way , '' Allison said , suggesting that Lynch 's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American . `` When it has taken so long , when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different ? '' Allison said . In March , Rep. G.K. Butterfield , D-North Carolina , chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , said , `` I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay , but it 's also the irrationality of the new Republicans . '' Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Illinois , evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans , saying Lynch had been `` asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar . '' Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona 's Sen. John McCain . `` I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation , mine and my Republican colleagues , '' McCain said on the Senate floor . `` It was offensive and unnecessary , and I think he owes this body , Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology , '' McCain added . `` I thought he should be commended , '' Lorenzo Lynch said . `` I think that 's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry , like most language , is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point . '' Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation . Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch 's nomination is because she is African-American . Many point out that Lynch , if confirmed , will be replacing the country 's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin . Instead , Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle . For some , it 's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate . For others , the delay is retaliation for President Obama 's 2014 executive actions on immigration . On the eve of Holder 's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice , the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would `` likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate . '' Some of Lynch 's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state 's two Republican senators to support Lynch 's confirmation . In March , several dozen North Carolina women , led by the NAACP , traveled to Washington to meet with their senators , Richard Burr and Thom Tillis . Reportedly , the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial . At a news conference at the Washington Press Club , the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination . `` Senator Burr and Senator Tillis , it is time for you to act like you have some sense . It 's past time . You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina , '' Allison said after the meeting . For their part , Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting : `` While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch 's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination , we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas . Weeks later , the NAACP organized protests outside the senators ' offices in Raleigh , Charlotte and Wilmington . `` I think there is a much deeper analysis , '' said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II . `` I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas , she would have been confirmed . '' `` Because of her courage , her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land , particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution , and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear , '' Barber said . Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation ` limbo ' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders . He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights . Now , his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter 's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House . Lynch admits that he 's never told his only daughter that he 's proud of her , although he 's sure she knows it . He plans to change that , soon , regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination .",the full senate panel is expected to decide for confirmation vote by the end of 12-8.,val,"['extrinsic-NP', 'intrinsic-NP']","[['by the end of 12-8'], ['12-8']]"

Steve Esmond , his teenage sons and the teens ' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John , where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort . The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States . The boys , 16 and 14 , were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday , the family 's lawyer , James Maron of Delaware , said . `` The boys are in rough shape , '' Maron said . `` The family are all fighters , '' he added . `` They 're fighting for everything right now . I understand it 's a long recovery . '' Esmond , also being treated at a hospital , is conscious but can not move , Maron said . The teens ' mother , Theresa Devine , was treated at a hospital but released , and is now in occupational therapy , Maron said . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses , which were reported to the EPA on March 20 . Paramedics were called to the villa , which the family began had been renting since March 14 . Esmond was found unconscious ; the boys and their mother were having seizures , Maron said . The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics . Elias Rodriguez , an EPA spokesman , said the agency 's preliminary test results `` do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying . '' Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects , including central nervous system and respiratory system damage , according to the EPA . The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity . It 's not allowed to be used indoors . Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings . `` It 's an ongoing investigation ; we 're still on the island doing our assessment , '' Rodriguez said . `` We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling . '' Final test results were expected next week . The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated . Maron , the family 's attorney , declined to comment on the investigation . Depending on the season , the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $ 550 and $ 1,200 per night . Sea Glass Vacations , which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa , said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests , but their unit was not treated . The company said it licensed an outside company , Terminix , for the pest control services . `` Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services , '' the company said in a statement . The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter , according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings , the parent company of Terminix . In an email to CNN , a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is `` committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers , employees , the public and the environment '' and is `` looking into this matter internally , and cooperating with authorities . '' `` We 're thinking about the family , and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery , '' Terminix wrote . The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as `` serious .

Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force -LRB- ASDF -RRB- had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

'' Those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean 's pop masterpiece `` American Pie . '' It 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8 1/2 minute allegory , which millions of Americans know by heart , is 44 years old . All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as `` Bye , Bye , Miss American Pie . '' There is no real way to categorize McLean 's `` American Pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock . On Tuesday , Christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . McLean was a paperboy when , on February 3 , 1959 , he saw that Buddy Holly , Ritchie Valens and J.P. `` The Big Bopper '' Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake , Iowa . `` The next day I went to school in shock and guess what ? '' McLean recalled . `` Nobody cared . Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 . '' By cathartically writing `` American Pie , '' McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever . Having recorded his first album , `` Tapestry , '' in 1969 , in Berkeley , California , during the student riots , McLean , a native New Yorker , became a kind of weather vane for what he called the `` generation lost in space . '' When his cultural anthem `` American Pie '' was released in November 1971 , it replaced Bob Dylan 's `` The Times They Are A Changin '' as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade . It 's important to think of `` American Pie '' as one would of Henry Longfellow 's `` Evangeline '' or Johnny Mercer 's `` Moon River '' -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection , blues valentine , and youthful protest rolled into one . There is magic brewing in the music and words of `` American Pie , '' for McLean 's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream , like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel `` On the Road . '' Don McLean : Buddy Holly , rest in peace . Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers , McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s , when `` American Pie '' topped the Billboard charts , and has never shed the cape . Wandering far and wide , singing `` American Pie '' at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England , at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley , McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times . Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure . When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing `` and they were singing '' everybody spontaneously joins in with the `` Bye , Bye '' chorus . Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening . What makes `` American Pie '' so unusual is that it is n't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman , which , like a sacred river , keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere . When `` American Pie '' suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it 's almost impossible not to sing along . Like `` Danny Boy '' or `` Streets of Laredo '' or `` Shenandoah , '' it 's eternal . With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll , river levees and nursery rhymes , the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes . After all these years , `` American Pie '' still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss . The song is alive and joyful , yet fretful about a world gone wrong . It is a song that will never die . A reverie for the ages . There is a jump to the chorus , which forces the mind to relive the '50s , '60s and '70s , to troll through the back pages of our lives while , like a traditional Irish folksong , it reminds us of fate . While McLean , the muse , has rightfully not tried to interpret `` American Pie , '' it 's fair to surmise that `` the king '' is Elvis Presley , `` Helter Skelter '' refers to the Charles Manson murders , the `` jester on the sidelines in a cast '' is Bob Dylan , and `` Jack Flash '' the Rolling Stones . But who knows ? The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations . As a literary artifact of the early 1970s , there is n't anything to compare to `` American Pie . '' Normally , I do n't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents , for that matter . But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose `` American Pie '' as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition 's importance as an enduring piece of pop art . The other four were `` Over the Rainbow '' -LRB- by Harold Arlen and E.Y `` Yip '' Harburg -RRB- , `` White Christmas '' -LRB- by Irving Berlin -RRB- , `` This Land is Your Land '' -LRB- by Woody Guthrie -RRB- and `` Respect '' -LRB- by Otis Redding -RRB- . That is fine company . Quite simply , `` American Pie '' is one of the greatest songs ever written . And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home .","""american pie"" is 44 years old.",val,,
Goyal’21,cnndm,3f034e41bd128350195c9dd75a74258f86b1fd06,"Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- Former rap mogul Marion `` Suge '' Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic `` Straight Outta Compton '' earlier this year . In addition to that ruling , Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight 's bail to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , a figure that defense lawyers called excessive . The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight . In all , Knight will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run , the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday . Knight , 49 , faces up to life in prison if convicted . Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots , and the case has clearly strained him : He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $ 25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment . Knight was in court Thursday . At the end of hearing , he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery , and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom . In a press conference after the hearing , fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight 's health that he is `` doing much better . '' The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon , in this case the vehicle Knight was driving , is used against several people . Knight is accused of running over two men , killing one of them , during an argument . Killed was Terry Carter , 55 . The survivor is Cle Sloan , 51 , who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan does n't want to be a `` snitch '' who sends Knight to prison , according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA . Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity , but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday , the affiliates reported . The deadly incident happened on January 29 , after a flare-up on the set of the biopic `` Straight Outta Compton , '' a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. . The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam 's Burgers in Compton . At the time , Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case . The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck . In the video , the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant , and he is then approached by Sloan , who was working security on the site . The two men appear to talk for a few moments , with Knight still in his vehicle . Suddenly , the vehicle backs up , knocking Sloan to the ground . While still in reverse , the truck moves out of range of the security camera . The vehicle is then seen zooming forward , back into camera range , running over Sloan a second time , and then running over a second man , Carter , a former rap music label owner . Carter later died . In closing arguments prior to the judge 's ruling , Knight 's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim . Knight was only defending himself against Sloan , whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time . `` Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor , '' Knight 's attorney argued . `` There 's no intent to kill , there 's an intent to survive . '' `` Even without a gun , we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight , '' the defense attorney said . Fletcher added that Knight 's defense was to stand his ground . Sloan `` needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor , '' Fletcher said . `` He is the person who got Terry -LRB- Carter -RRB- killed . '' Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued , however , told the judge that Knight was engaged in `` mutual combat situation '' where he used his car as deadly weapon . If Knight `` ever had the right of self-defense , the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over , he lost the right of self-defense , '' Barnes said . `` There was pre-mediation and intent when he -LRB- Knight -RRB- ran over him a second time . '' Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30 . The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight , who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg -LRB- now known as Snoop Lion -RRB- and Tupac Shakur . Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996 . Shortly afterward , Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions . That prison time -- along with Shakur 's death , feuds between Knight and a number of rappers , and desertions by Dr. Dre , Snoop and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006 . In August , Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards .","he suffers from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic ""straight outta compton"" earlier this year.",test,['intrinsic-predicate'],[['suffers from (faces charges stemming from)']]

The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague , in the Netherlands , where the court is based . The Palestinians signed the ICC 's founding Rome Statute in January , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed `` in the occupied Palestinian territory , including East Jerusalem , since June 13 , 2014 . '' Later that month , the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis . As members of the court , Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well . Israel and the United States , neither of which is an ICC member , opposed the Palestinians ' efforts to join the body . But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki , speaking at Wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an ICC news release . `` Indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' Judge Kuniko Ozaki , a vice president of the ICC , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians . `` As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine , Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute . These are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development . `` Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said Balkees Jarrah , international justice counsel for the group . `` What 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not Palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' In January , when the preliminary ICC examination was opened , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . The United States also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` As we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC , '' the State Department said in a statement . It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` Palestine . '' While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality . '' The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June . The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes .

Goyal’21,cnndm,2dac7b4a9ed9eb9cfcabae0e8e0eb07abc5b8860,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- After two days of deliberation , jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing . The verdict is n't surprising . What might be , however , is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again . Because there could be other more young men just like him , which means the lessons we take from Boston will affect whether we can keep America and Americans safer . Today , nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are Muslim . By 2050 , Pew reports , that will be some 1 out of 3 . By 2070 ? Well , I 'll quote the all-caps headline reprinted by the Drudge Report : `` Muslims to outnumber Christians ! '' Many Americans read such numbers and worry : Will this mean more Dzhokhar Tsarnaevs ? But that 's only if you believe Islam causes extremism , which many have argued . And that 's wrong , of course . On the other hand , there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism . Which is true -- and false . Sure , the Islamic faith forbids murder , but there 's a small but significant minority of Muslims murdering people in terrible ways , and in Islam 's name . Understanding what leads young Muslims like Dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization . At any given moment in the Middle East , we have little idea who 's going to attack whom next , who 's on whom 's side , how this is going to end , or what anyone 's even fighting over anymore . This bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better . But it will get better . To understand why , we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes Muslims . Contrary to common belief , Muslims are n't unusually predisposed to violence . Radical Islam , which has taken on an ugly life of its own , began at the intersection of politics , religion and religious identity . Islam is about what you believe , but it 's also about being part of a community . And what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack ? Some Muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions -LRB- the road to hell , after all -RRB- . Consider : The tragedy of modern Islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies . Before my time , the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan horrified many Muslims . When I was in high school , Bosnia occupied all our attention . There was of course Russia 's brutal war on the Chechen people -- Dzhokhar shares his name with a recent Chechen patriot -- and Israel 's ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories . And the blows against Muslims do n't end there . There was Serbia 's war on Kosovo , another war in Chechnya , the invasion of Iraq , oppression in Myanmar , civil strife in Syria , the colonization of East Turkestan , massacres of Muslims in the Central African Republic , wars on a besieged Gaza and West Bank still under Israeli rule . Imagine how this looks to a restless young Muslim . Countless places where co-religionists have been killed , and nobody seems to do anything about it . Nobody even wants to . Extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening , and then moved quickly to a single , tempting , terrible response : Take up arms -- and kill . In her new book , `` Heretic : Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now '' , Ayaan Hirsi Ali argues that extremism is n't caused by political circumstances , but by Islam itself . Her conclusion is wrong . To fight extremism , we do n't need to reform Islam . We need to show young Muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to . Rather than help Muslims , it 's harming them . When I was a teenager , our Massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from Bosnia that shared graphic , heartbreaking stories of rape , exile , and massacre inflicted on Muslims , all because of their faith . The mosque raised money , collected food , blankets , medicine . Promises were made to provide more , and regularly . But we all knew that was n't enough . As we left the mosque , my peers and I were disgruntled and confused . Shocked . Angry . Our teachers could 've told us : Go and fight . Defend your Muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege . Or they could 've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably . Neither answer would have satisfied . Fortunately for us , they offered us a third way . They showed us , patiently , how to work with others , how to compromise , how to get things done . A more engaged American Muslim community , they explained , could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world . They were right . We saw the dead-end road of radicalism from afar , but we also saw , up close , how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless , ineffectual and ignored . Thanks to social media , a medium that the world 's burgeoning young Muslim population is increasingly comfortable with , more Muslims can and will see this , too . Radicalism will be done in by fellow Muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it . It 's happening already . Our national conversation about Islam is focused on the wrong issues . Does Islam need a Reformation ? What in Islam causes violence ? We would do a lot better if we accepted that Muslims the world over have real grievances -- dictatorships , corruption , foreign intervention , religious illiteracy , lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these . We need to show the young Dzhokhars that , if they want to help , then violence is n't going to help . To fight extremism , we need to pose this question to young Muslims : `` Do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith ? '' Because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse . Their narrative has failed . Their solution is bankrupt . The Caliph wears no clothes . It 's the reason why increasing numbers of Muslims reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing .",the tsarnaev says it's a 1 out of 4 people in a world.,test,['intrinsic-NP'],"[['the tsarnaev'], ['people in a world']]"
Goyal’21,cnndm,a2ee2faeb2dc4e5eab43b1d14233c4ac658f0a8f,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- President Barack Obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran even before he became the Democratic candidate for president . Reaching a good , solid agreement with Iran is a worthy , desirable goal . But the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening America 's hand and strengthening Iran . Obama 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it . There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the United States and not Iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though Iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months . The reason is that Obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations . The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. Few believe it , particularly in the Middle East and notably among America 's Arab friends , who hold the view that Iran is running circles around the United States and outplayed Obama . As the writer David Rothkopf aptly put it , `` Iran is having a great Obama administration . '' That 's a belief that has already started shaking up the region . Saudi Arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes Iran has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among Iran 's Muslim rivals will do the same . In fact , the notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen , where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran 's allies . We can trace it all back to the Democratic primaries in 2007 , when then-Sen . Obama said he would meet Iran 's leaders `` without preconditions , '' leading his rival , Hillary Clinton , to call the idea `` Irresponsible and frankly naive . '' As the years of his presidency unfolded , and the Middle East started coming apart , finding a deal with Iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement Obama might leave behind . The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace . The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama 's March 31 deadline . The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States , and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a `` bad tactic . '' That bad tactic was a political move , a push to produce some sort of result , however vague , to protect the talks from critics . Again , a solid agreement that ensures Iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development . But the agreement so far does not look promising . It certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what Obama had vowed . In a presidential debate in 2012 , Obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations . `` The deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program . It 's very straightforward . '' Nobody is talking about Iran ending its nuclear program . Not even close . Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges . That 's not a small symbolic number . And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled , although Fordow will contain no nuclear materials . Iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses . The fact is that Iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to U.N. inspectors . And the U.N. agency chief says that has not stopped . A couple of weeks ago , with days left until the negotiating deadline , U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano said Iran is still stonewalling . `` We are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is -LSB- for a -RSB- peaceful purpose , '' he warned . The negotiations ' starting point is that Iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably , forever . The world only learned about Iran 's secret facilities at Arak and Natanz after dissidents raised the alarm . Iran , we have learned repeatedly , is very good at lying to international inspectors . It is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program . It is well-established that many of Iran 's neighbors do n't trust it and are anxious about the U.S.-led international dealings with Iran . It is well-established that Iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region . It is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring Iran to the negotiating table . It was Iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks . But political considerations turned the United States into the supplicant . The framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon . Nuclear enrichment will continue , although at a lower level . Iran officially , legally , becomes a nuclear threshold state , with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a `` breakout '' period of one year , the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act . Even the Fordow facility , conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain , will remain in existence , though `` converted '' to a nuclear `` research facility '' And without nuclear material on site . International sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately . Its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place , even if operating at a reduced pace , giving Iran much of what it wanted . With Iranian forces gaining ground in Arab lands and Iranian commanders declaring the destruction of Israel `` nonnegotiable '' and threatening Saudi Arabia , this deal does not look reassuring . Obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option . But the deal so far looks like -LRB- another -RRB- win for Iran . It introduces enough restrictions that it could give the President the political cover he wants , but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the Middle East .",ghitis: iran's muslim rivals are not to blame iran's leaders for president.,val,['entire_sent'],[['very bad']]

Goyal’21,cnndm,e8c90d557031700caa1afb66dfc85358ef719108,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion , especially in Indiana , where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people . Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993 , designed to prohibit the federal government from `` substantially burdening '' a person 's exercise of religion . So far , 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law , and the legal controversies have grown , too . Nonetheless , claims under those state RFRAs are `` exceedingly rare , '' and victories involved mostly religious minorities , not Christian denominations , experts say . `` There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers , '' wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis , when there were only 16 states with such laws . Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws , touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon : . He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes . But not in the eyes of the feds . In 2006 , Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers , in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act , which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground . Soto , a Lipan Apache , asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony . The feathers are sacred to Native Americans . But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe was n't federally recognized , and Soto surrendered his feathers . Russell , who is married to Soto 's sister , is n't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine , according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal . Soto , however , petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers . The feds said no , because he was n't from a recognized tribe . Soto and Russell sued the federal government , but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government , rejecting the two men 's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act , the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law . But last August , the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court 's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government 's action would violate the federal RFRA . On March 10 , the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto . But the legal war is n't over . The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants , so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction , claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA , said Luke Goodrich , Soto 's attorney who 's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty . A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion , but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug . The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca , made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine , a hallucinogen , in violation of the Controlled Substances Act . The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions . About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion . In May 1999 , U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe , New Mexico , and seized all of its hoasca . The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug , peyote , in their religious ceremonies . In fact , the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans ' use of peyote , said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin . `` They were a legitimate religion , and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion , and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected , '' Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law . The Uniao do Vegetal , which means `` the union of the plants , '' cited that federal law in suing the federal government . `` The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church 's use of peyote -LRB- which contains mescaline , also a controlled substance -RRB- but can not accommodate the UDV 's use of hoasca , '' the church said in a statement . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church 's favor , saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use . `` The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government 's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA , '' the court ruling said . Bruce Rich , an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida , wanted kosher meals , but the warden said no . So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010 , saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 , a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law . Rich , 66 , is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents , in their 70s , in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home . The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns , namely `` retaliation against the kosher inmates '' if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food , court papers said . At least 35 other states and the federal government , however , provided kosher diets to inmates . After losing before a magistrate , Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court , which cited `` the defendant 's meager efforts to explain why Florida 's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida . '' Recently baptized in the Sikh faith , Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item : a 9-inch kirpan , a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved . Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith . But the federal government banned her from the building , citing the kirpan as a `` dangerous weapon '' with a more than 3-inch blade , and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace . Tagore sued the government under the federal law . Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects : real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes , said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund . Also , federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives . In November , the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore 's trial . The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing , the Christian Science Monitor reported . Tagore 's attorneys described the settlement as `` a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings , '' they said in a statement . Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes does n't always equate to victory . In Chicago , an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones . The ministers needed a special use permit , but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one , the church leaders claimed . In fact , it was easier to get a club , lodge or community center approved . So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000 , alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute , the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution . But in 2003 , the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group 's claims , finding no substantial burden on the churches , which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim . Defeated , church leaders were angry . `` The forty -LRB- 40 -RRB- churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000 , '' Apostle Theodore Wilkinson , the group 's chairman , said in a statement . `` Also alarming is the court 's conclusion that Chicago 's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws . The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing , '' he said . At the same time , the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid `` the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA , '' according to a League of California Cities report in 2002 .

He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury 's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet : `` This one was on film . '' Now , he 's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks . `` Stopped by the cops again wish me luck , '' he posted early Tuesday , along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background . He posted similar photos in February . Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason , calling it `` driving while black . '' Blacks are about 30 % more likely to be pulled over by police than whites , according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013 . And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , the issue is even more sensitive . Rock has n't commented on the tweets and did n't say how the police stop turned out . He got lots of support on Twitter . `` My heart legit dropped , no kidding , '' one Twitter fan posted . Many praised him for documenting the stops . Some accused him of race-baiting . But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media . Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to '' #Adapt '' to avoid racial profiling . `` I sold my $ 90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius 's , because I got tired of being pulled over by Police , '' Washington tweeted . Some saw that as a sell-out , saying Rock should n't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over . `` Let me guess . . you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well ? . '' Twitter user YeshaCallahan posted . Appearing on CNN , Washington defended the tweet , saying he wanted to `` excite a conversation . '' Years ago , Rock filmed a sketch for his `` Chris Rock '' show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man . Besides obeying the law , he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride . He did just that last year in a segment of `` Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee '' with Jerry Seinfeld . The two chat as Seinfeld drives an orange Lamborghini . And what happened ? They get pulled over after Seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas . `` Here 's the crazy thing , '' Rock tells Seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo . `` If you were n't here , I 'd be scared .

'' Sure , he can shred it on `` Girls , Girls , Girls '' and `` Dr. Feelgood , '' but this is a different story -- a completely different story . To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession . There 's less carnage when butchers are done with their work . The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV . In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991 , a patriotic America saluted her performance . Just six months earlier , comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark . The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W.

Goyal’21,cnndm,469c6ac05092ca5997728c9dfc19f9ab6b936e40,"Marseille , France -LRB- CNN -RRB- The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane . Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that `` so far no videos were used in the crash investigation . '' He added , `` A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators . '' Robin 's comments follow claims by two magazines , German daily Bild and French Paris Match , of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps . All 150 on board were killed . Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site . The two publications described the supposed video , but did not post it on their websites . The publications said that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation . `` One can hear cries of ` My God ' in several languages , '' Paris Match reported . `` Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . Towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . Then nothing . '' `` It is a very disturbing scene , '' said Julian Reichelt , editor-in-chief of Bild online . An official with France 's accident investigation agency , the BEA , said the agency is not aware of any such video . Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini , a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site , told CNN that the reports were `` completely wrong '' and `` unwarranted . '' Cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they `` had n't been exploited yet . '' Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois , near Paris , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators . But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , Menichini said . Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , Menichini answered with a categorical `` no . '' Reichelt told `` Erin Burnett : Outfront '' that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying Bild and Paris Match are `` very confident '' that the clip is real . He noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports . `` That is something we did not know before . ... Overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , '' he said . What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot ? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525 , which he 's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps . Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a `` previous episode of severe depression , '' the airline said Tuesday . Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation , Lufthansa said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . The announcement indicates that Lufthansa , the parent company of Germanwings , knew of Lubitz 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . Lufthansa , whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement Tuesday as a `` swift and seamless clarification '' and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday , where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside . He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes , laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet , closer to the crash site , where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial . Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching . French President Francois Hollande , speaking Tuesday , said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week , sooner than authorities had previously suggested . In the meantime , the recovery of the victims ' personal belongings will start Wednesday , Menichini said . Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board . Check out the latest from our correspondents . The details about Lubitz 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz 's possible motive for downing the jet . A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and `` held all the licenses required . '' Earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in Dusseldorf , Christoph Kumpa , said medical records reveal Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license . Kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday . While flying was `` a big part of his life , '' the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . Another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . Lubitz 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the European government official said . But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said Brian Russell , a forensic psychologist . `` Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , '' he said . `` But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems .

To most of the outside world , this war-torn country is off limits , the weeks-long battle between Houthi rebels and Saudi-led coalition forces making it too dangerous to visit , and a no-fly zone rendering its international airport all but obsolete -- but on Tuesday , CNN was granted rare access on a desperate aid mission by Unicef , the United Nations Children 's Fund . The airport has previously been bombed . Hostilities are likely to resume before the day is out : a brief , peaceful window has been delicately negotiated following a special request from the U.N. -- but it wo n't last long . Unicef hopes there will be just enough time to deliver vital food and supplies , helping to ease the country 's worsening humanitarian crisis . More than 100,000 Yemeni civilians have fled their homes since fighting began , and OCHA , the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , estimates that 15.9 million people here are in need of assistance . The main terminal at El Rahaba Airport is under the control of the Houthi rebels . We ca n't get near it for fear of provoking trouble . But there is plenty to be done out on the tarmac . Within minutes of touching down , a small army of aid workers is busy unloading huge mounds of much-needed provisions . Gusts of wind blow dust across the runway , as crates and pallets of emergency nutrition and medical equipment pile up rapidly beside the plane . Unicef 's team has overcome more than one hurdle just getting it this far -- now they 'll have to work out how to distribute it to those most in need in a country paralyzed by a lack of resources . Even before Saudi airstrikes , most of the 25 million people in Yemen required humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs , according to the United Nations . As they work , an Air India plane is taxiing away from the terminal . Thousands have fled the country on evacuation flights in recent weeks as the situation in Yemen has deteriorated . But for those who have nowhere else to go and no chance of a flight out , mercy missions by Unicef and other NGOs like it are the only hope .

'' Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step , while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country . The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur , but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy . The law allows for the procedure if `` necessary to protect the life or health of the mother , '' according to a statement on Brownback 's website . On Twitter , Brownback , a Republican , said he was proud to sign a law `` protecting life at its most vulnerable stage . '' Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move , which it described as the latest in a series of `` extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability .

The greater adjutant stork initially drew Bouldry to Boragaon , but he became connected with the people . About 100 families live inside the Boragaon landfill . Every day , they search the area for treasure -- a tiny scrap of metal , a bit of plastic , maybe a bone . They use large hooks to sort through the garbage , which sometimes reaches two or three stories high . They work in teams , and more than often they are barefoot . `` They do n't look at the things they 're doing as being unsanitary or unhealthy or unsafe , '' Bouldry said . They collect plastic , metal and wires and sell it by the pound . The families make around $ 2 per day . Their homes are constructed by recycled materials , with sometimes several families living in one shanty at a time . With no electricity , no running water -- and an overabundance of trash -- they are experts at repurposing . `` You might see a refrigerator being used as a closet , '' he said . Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography . Some of the children living in Boragaon go to school on scholarship , but most of them work in the landfill to provide for their families .

Goyal’21,cnndm,c811d9ae87c9bfbf31481bf8a916dc0b8e083a60,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- There was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed : The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus . The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it . The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students . That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called `` Jackie , '' especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out . The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012 , and Jackie told the university about it the next spring . She started telling her story very publicly , including at a `` take back the night '' rally . But Charlottesville police did n't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014 , in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face . When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident . In both cases , police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case . But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie 's . Rolling Stone 's story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims . Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus . They 'd call it a `` bad experience . '' Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being `` rapey '' and for using date-rape drugs . That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman 's outfit . And if a woman did report her rape , some women complained that the internal process did n't seem worth it if their abuser would n't be kicked out of school . Rolling Stone had a line in its original story : `` UVA 's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams . And yet paradoxically , not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault . '' After the article published , UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined , so it 's unclear what it means . When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone 's website , that was lost . `` You lose a lot of other people 's voices who were in that article , '' said Sarah Roderick , a survivor and UVA student , `` and a lot of good things that could have come about . Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus '' -- and , she added , across the nationo . Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation , there 's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit . The attorney who filed the suit , James Marsh , told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he 's representing , making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice . When the Columbia Journalism School 's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up , it really boils down to this : The mistake could have been avoided if the writer , Sabrina Rubin Erdely , had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night .

Goyal’21,cnndm,cdcdb9afa458d94e8973dd6a095a3f78da202101,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- The lawyer for Robert Bates , an Oklahoma reserve deputy who fatally shot a man he meant to subdue with a Taser , on Saturday released documents that he says verify some of Bates ' training as a law enforcement officer . The documents show Bates had one Taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period , took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times , from 2009 to 2014 , to use a handgun . His evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public . `` Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy , '' said the lawyer , Scott Wood , in an interview with CNN . Read the documents . CNN could not independently confirm the documents were authentic . Wood said he got them from Bates , who asked the Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office to provide his training records . The sheriff 's office has turned down CNN 's requests for the training documents , saying they are part of the investigation . Authorities did not reply Saturday to a request for comment on Wood 's statements . The documents are important because Bates ' training has become a central issue in the case . The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates , 73 , was n't qualified to be on the force , but received preferential treatment because he 'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff . The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office were told to forge Bates ' records and were reassigned when they refused . The Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office has denied these allegations . The documents provided to CNN cover the period from July 22 , 2008 , to December 12 , 2014 . Bates had one Taser training class , on March 4 , 2009 , according to a document with a heading from The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training , which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state . Wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a Taser . Bates had weapons training once in September 2008 and twice in 2009 , according to sheriff 's office records that Bates obtained , Wood said . He scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from September 24 , 2009 , to April 9 , 2014 , that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty , Wood said . Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris . Friends and family of Harris gathered in Tulsa on Saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing . Bates is free on $ 25,000 bond . He says he meant to use his Taser on Harris during the April 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead . `` I shot him ! I 'm sorry ! '' Bates is heard saying on video of the incident . Bates , an insurance company executive , has gone to his own defense . In an interview Friday with the `` Today '' show on NBC , Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies . `` That is absolutely the truth . I have it in writing , '' he told the show . Questions have already been raised about Bates ' training and when his service with the Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office started . In his statement to investigators , Bates said he `` became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007 . '' Wood said Bates started working for the sheriff 's office in late 2007 or 2008 . But the sheriff 's office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008 . Bates , who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s , completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy , according to the sheriff 's office . The Tulsa World said 480 hours of field training are required to be an `` advanced '' reserve deputy , which Bates claimed to be . Questions have been raised about Bates ' firearms qualifications scores . To be allowed to carry a pistol on duty , deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range , Wood said . Documents with a heading `` Firearms Qualification Record '' show Bates scoring at least 72 on six different days . But firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff 's office , Wood said . The Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office says it ca n't find the records . The department 's summary of Bates ' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times . `` If you 're going to forge somebody 's score why not give them a 90 or a 95 , '' Wood said . CNN provided the documents to the Tulsa World . Ziva Branstetter , an editor with the newspaper , said the new information does n't undercut the World 's reporting . `` These records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story , '' she said Saturday . Another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes Bates took on two days . The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training records show Bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on December 10 , 2013 , and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on December 11 , 2014 . Wood said Bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes . `` It 's possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes , '' he said . Evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of Bates . One from March 14 , 2009 , says of his strengths : `` Works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well . '' His weakness : `` Radio usage/geography . '' Remedial training : `` Does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on . Will have to work on his geography skills . Both will be remedied in time ! ''",documents show bates had one taser training class to use a handgun.,val,['intrinsic-predicate'],[['to use a handgun']]

To most of the outside world , this war-torn country is off limits , the weeks-long battle between Houthi rebels and Saudi-led coalition forces making it too dangerous to visit , and a no-fly zone rendering its international airport all but obsolete -- but on Tuesday , CNN was granted rare access on a desperate aid mission by Unicef , the United Nations Children 's Fund . The airport has previously been bombed . Hostilities are likely to resume before the day is out : a brief , peaceful window has been delicately negotiated following a special request from the U.N. -- but it wo n't last long . Unicef hopes there will be just enough time to deliver vital food and supplies , helping to ease the country 's worsening humanitarian crisis . More than 100,000 Yemeni civilians have fled their homes since fighting began , and OCHA , the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , estimates that 15.9 million people here are in need of assistance . The main terminal at El Rahaba Airport is under the control of the Houthi rebels . We ca n't get near it for fear of provoking trouble . But there is plenty to be done out on the tarmac . Within minutes of touching down , a small army of aid workers is busy unloading huge mounds of much-needed provisions . Gusts of wind blow dust across the runway , as crates and pallets of emergency nutrition and medical equipment pile up rapidly beside the plane . Unicef 's team has overcome more than one hurdle just getting it this far -- now they 'll have to work out how to distribute it to those most in need in a country paralyzed by a lack of resources . Even before Saudi airstrikes , most of the 25 million people in Yemen required humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs , according to the United Nations . As they work , an Air India plane is taxiing away from the terminal . Thousands have fled the country on evacuation flights in recent weeks as the situation in Yemen has deteriorated . But for those who have nowhere else to go and no chance of a flight out , mercy missions by Unicef and other NGOs like it are the only hope .

Standing about 5 feet tall with an average wingspan of 8 feet , it soars over the Boragaon landfill like a great protector . It knows the residents and shies away from strangers . `` They are intelligent birds . Every time I got close to them they would fly away , '' photographer Timothy Bouldry said . The dirty , wet conditions of the landfill attracted the endangered stork , and the stork attracted Bouldry . Through a series of photos taken within a day , he captures what it 's like to live inside one of the largest dumping grounds in India . The Boragaon landfill is located in the city of Guwahati , about 300 miles from Bangladesh near the Bhutanese border . It 's 94 acres of mostly fresh waste , surrounded by swamplands . -LRB- Other landfills , Bouldry says , contain older , compacted trash . -RRB- . For the past seven years , Bouldry has traveled the world photographing landfills . He 's visited places such as Haiti , Venezuela and Colombia . The greater adjutant stork initially drew Bouldry to Boragaon , but he became connected with the people . About 100 families live inside the Boragaon landfill . Every day , they search the area for treasure -- a tiny scrap of metal , a bit of plastic , maybe a bone . They use large hooks to sort through the garbage , which sometimes reaches two or three stories high . They work in teams , and more than often they are barefoot . `` They do n't look at the things they 're doing as being unsanitary or unhealthy or unsafe , '' Bouldry said . They collect plastic , metal and wires and sell it by the pound . The families make around $ 2 per day . Their homes are constructed by recycled materials , with sometimes several families living in one shanty at a time . With no electricity , no running water -- and an overabundance of trash -- they are experts at repurposing . `` You might see a refrigerator being used as a closet , '' he said . Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography . Some of the children living in Boragaon go to school on scholarship , but most of them work in the landfill to provide for their families . But do n't be deceived : The people living here feel anything but destitute . Bouldry uses words such as `` love , '' `` hope '' and `` spirituality '' to describe them . `` I found that the landfill community is content , '' Bouldry said . `` They are not jaded by modern civilization . '' Bouldry lives and works inside the La Chureca landfill in Nicaragua , one of the largest landfills in the world . He helps the people living there grow gardens fertilized with compost he makes with organic waste from local smoothie shops . In addition to his photography , he teaches English and yoga classes a few times per week . But why ? Bouldry went to art school in Boston . He 's no stranger to sophisticated civilization . He said he found humanitarian photo projects to be the most fulfilling , and he became especially intrigued by landfills even though they are `` scary , dirty and kind of grotesque .

Goyal’21,cnndm,ba2ec653b7d0c46759f39aef6dac850c9229716f,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- This week 's attack on Garissa University College is Al-Shabaab 's fifth major assault in Kenya in the past year and a half . The Thursday massacre was the most deadly assault so far , with 147 dead , easily eclipsing the terrorist group 's most notorious attack , a four-day siege in late September 2013 at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed . After the Westgate attack , Al-Shabaab unleashed a string of attacks in Kenya that have killed more than 100 people -- assaulting the coastal town of Mpeketoni on June 16 , 2014 ; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the Quran on November 22 , 2014 ; and then , days later , executing Christian quarry laborers . Why is Al-Shabaab , a Somali nationalist , Islamist group affiliated with al Qaeda , targeting Kenya ? Al-Shabaab says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 Kenyan soldiers participating in the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia . But if that is the case , why does n't Al-Shabaab target Kenyan military bases rather than attacking undefended so-called soft targets such as Kenyan malls and universities ? In fact , Thursday 's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of Al-Shabaab , which has steadily been losing ground for years in Somalia as a result of the African Union forces fighting them there , as well as a covert U.S. drone and Special Operations Forces campaign that has also degraded the group 's capabilities . In 2006 , Al-Shabaab controlled the Somali capital of Mogadishu and , in the following years , much of central and southern Somalia . Six years later , African Union forces had recaptured Mogadishu , parts of southern Somalia and critical cities such as Kismayo . The loss of Kismayo , Al-Shabaab 's last city stronghold and an important port , took a financial toll on the group . Ground battles with African Union forces have decimated Al-Shabaab 's rank-and-file , while U.S. drone strikes and Special Operations raids have killed some of the group 's leaders . In the past four years , according to a count by New America , the U.S. has launched a dozen drone strikes and six Special Operations raids against Al-Shabaab . These strikes and raids -- almost all occurring in southern Somalia -- have targeted the terrorist group 's training camps and leaders . American drones or special operators have killed 10 leaders : Aden Hashi Ayro , the top commander ; Ahmed Abdi Godane , Ayro 's successor ; a top commander , Sheikh Muhidin Mohamud Omar ; Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , a senior official who operated training camps ; commander Jabreel Malik Muhammed ; Bilal al-Berjawi , the deputy of military leader Fazul Abdullah Mohammed ; chief bomb-maker Ibrahim Ali Abdi ; intelligence chief Tahlil Abdishakur ; Yusef Dheeq , the chief of external operations and planning for intelligence and security ; and Adan Garar , who was involved in planning the Westgate Mall attack . Al-Shabaab has been unraveling for years . Thursday 's attack should remind the world that the group is a pale shadow of the organization that once dominated much of Somalia but now is reduced to high profile attacks against undefended civilian targets .",garissa university college is al-shabaab's fifth major assault in kenya in the past year.,test,['intrinsic-NP'],[['garissa university college is']]

Goyal’21,cnndm,a2363d02185ba79b223bf7290b390cf65f81dd50,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- Are we alone in the cosmos ? Or might there be intelligent life elsewhere ? Last week , NASA scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two . This year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun , 51 Pegasi . Since then , ground-based surveys and NASA 's Kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed `` exoplanets , '' and thousands more candidates await confirmation . Many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system . Some have large planets like Jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than Mercury , the innermost planet in our solar system . But smaller rocky planets like Earth , though harder to find , appear to be even more abundant . Life on Earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed . That suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life . Life as we know it is carbon-based and requires liquid water . Astronomers define the `` habitable zone '' around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet 's surface . Any closer to the star , the water will boil into vapor ; any farther and the water freezes into ice . Extrapolating from discoveries to date , astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion Earth-like , habitable-zone planets in our Milky Way galaxy alone . Of course , there is a difference between single-celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals , which appeared about 200 million years ago . And then the humans , who have existed for only 200,000 years . Intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on Earth . So while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen , the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did , with ears and spoken language , or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny . And life that can use radio waves has existed on Earth for only 0.000002 % of the planet 's history -- 100 years out of 4.5 billion . If the half dozen or so rocky , Earth-like exoplanets now known are similar , the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as , well , winning your state lottery with one ticket . Of course , if there are 40 billion Earth-like planets out there , the odds improve quite a bit . If they all have histories like the Earth 's , there might be 1,000 planets in the Milky Way that could support communicative beings . But before you start composing your first letter to an alien , think about this : The chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule . Another planet 's 100 years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago , or it might happen a billion years in the future . A lot depends on how long communication capabilities last . Civilizations that can build huge telescopes and broadcast stations also have the technology to destroy their planet . So the duration of the Communication Age on a planet could be short . Not to mention : The average light-travel-time to such a planet could be tens of thousands of years , so unless humans evolve to be ageless , we 're not exchanging IMs with aliens anytime soon . If advanced civilizations can maintain their capabilities for millions of years or more , the chances of communicating with them are not negligible . But in that case , they are likely to be far more sophisticated than we are -LRB- since they developed the capability far earlier than we did -RRB- -- so if they wanted us to know they exist , would n't they simply tell us ? The SETI project has been listening for such broadcasts for more than 30 years in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence . Probably the most likely form of life on exoplanets is far more primitive . Astronomers have found signatures of organic molecules , the building blocks of life , in the interstellar material that permeates the space between stars in our galaxy . Possible signatures of living organisms on distant exoplanets include an oxygen-rich atmosphere , such as that created by the first bacteria on Earth , or perhaps methane or carbon dioxide . NASA 's James Webb Space Telescope , to be launched in 2018 , will look for evidence of life in the atmospheres of rocky , habitable exoplanets . NASA 's rovers have shown that Mars was once much more habitable . It had fresh-water lakes and streams of water running along its surface . Some water still remains , and there may yet be life discovered on Mars . New missions plan to look at Europa and Ganymede , moons of Jupiter that have liquid water below their icy surfaces . Life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own Milky Way galaxy , is practically inevitable . Signs of life on exoplanets orbiting nearby stars will probably be discovered in the coming decades with advanced telescopes . But the chance of talking to those little green men will probably have to wait for another few hundred million years .","the ""habitable zone"" is a star in our solar system.",val,['entire_sent'],[['very bad']]
Goyal’21,cnndm,34cb179dfa67e280999a620bfafd4b770a80aa53,"Kano , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- An explosion late Thursday outside a bus station in the northeast Nigerian city of Gombe killed at least five people and injured more than a dozen others , witnesses said . The explosion outside the Bauchi Motor Park happened around 8:30 p.m. after a woman left her explosives-laden handbag near a bus filling up with passengers . The bus was heading to the central Nigerian city of Jos , 125 kilometers away . `` There has been an explosion just outside the motor park and five people have been killed while more than 12 others have been seriously injured , '' said Adamu Saidu , an employee at the bus station . `` Some of the injured have had their limbs blown off and one of them has had his eye gouged out , '' said Saidu , who was involved in the evacuation of the victims to a hospital . The woman pretended to be going to Jos and lingered around the bus , which was waiting to fill up with passengers , according to Falalu Tasiu , a grocer near the bus station . `` The woman kept talking on the phone and dropped her bag beside the bus , pretending to be waiting for the bus to fill up , '' Tasiu said . `` She moved towards shops overlooking the bus station as if she was going to buy something and disappeared . Moments later the bag exploded and set the bus on fire , killing five people and inujuring around 15 others , '' Tasiu said . Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack , Boko Haram Islamists have repeatedly carried out suicide and bombing attacks on bus stations and markets in Gombe and other northern cities , making the group the main suspect . Boko Haram has in recent months been under sustained pressure from sweeping offensives from a four-nation regional alliance of Nigeria , Chad , Niger and Cameroon . The regional offensives have considerably weakened Boko Haram 's capabilities , which has prompted the Islamists to resort to attacks on soft targets such as bus stations , markets and schools . The explosion was the first attack since Nigeria held its presidential election at the weekend , which was won by opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari , who vowed to crush Boko Haram when he assumes office in late May .",the blast is the first of the attack in nigerian city.,test,['intrinsic-NP'],[['first of the attack']]

Goyal’21,cnndm,dc8bb8429f624c4cceea3caae72874acb85e69b3,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- I remember the day I stopped praying . It was the day after my little brother , Jimmy , died of cancer . He was 25 . I was so angry at God . I was 27 at the time , and , like most young people I had stopped going to church . But , on that day -- that terrible day -- I desperately needed to understand why God took my brother . I called the nearest Catholic church , looking for a priest . A lady picked up the phone . `` Can I talk with Father ? '' I asked . I wish I could say her answer was `` yes . '' Instead , she asked me if I was a member of that particular parish . `` Does it matter ? '' I asked . -LRB- At the time I lived far from my home parish . -RRB- I do n't remember how she responded , but the answer about my being able to see Father was clearly no . I do n't know if all Catholic churches would have shut me out , but I figured , at the time , it was part of the long list of rules the Vatican required Catholic leaders to follow . I cried for a bit , then decided I would never ask God for anything . Clearly , his conduits on Earth did not have time for me -- a lifelong Catholic -- and sinner -- so why would he ? Ever since , I 've considered myself a lapsed Catholic . Until Pope Francis . There is something about Francis that 's reawakened my faith . And it 's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church . He still argues against things I passionately support , but I find myself -- like many other lapsed Catholics -- enthralled . Recently I had the pleasure of meeting one of the Pope 's newly appointed cardinals . His name is Cardinal Gerald Lacroix . The 57-year-old presides at the Basilica Cathedral of Notre Dame in Quebec City . One of my first questions : What is it about Pope Francis ? `` Every person is a mystery you know . ... But what 's evident is this man is living with such freedom , such inner freedom . He 's himself . He 's in tune with the Lord , '' Lacroix told me . `` Those close to him say he 's up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily Mass , which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays . So that 's almost three hours of prayer , preparation and silence before the Lord and the word of God . Wow , that really fine-tunes you to start off a day . '' Perhaps that 's how the Pope stays humble . Why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled , women and those of other faiths . Why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in St. Peter 's Square . All of this is appealing , but it 's more than that . In my mind , it 's his tone . When Pope Francis said , `` If a person is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will , who am I to judge ? '' The comment took me aback . Homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the Vatican , yet Pope Francis uttered those welcoming words . Lacroix likened the Pope 's approach to Jesus . `` Jesus did n't judge . Jesus did not come as a judge . He came as someone who preached and talked about the love of God . '' Those kinds of answers are so different in my experience , but I understand why more conservative Catholics worry . If the Pope does not judge , then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not ? `` I hear that sometimes , too , '' Lacroix told me . `` I think Pope Francis is conservative in the right way . You have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation : that 's the Gospel . You can not reproach Pope Francis of not living the Gospel , or not preaching the truth of the Gospel . '' But is n't homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church ? `` There is room for everyone . The door is open , '' Cardinal Lacroix insisted . `` Of course you know that the Catholic Church will never promote same sex marriage , but do we respect homosexual persons ? Do we welcome them ? Do we accompany them ? Of course . But to respect the Church and its teaching , which is based on a long tradition and also the word of God , we will not go so far as to bless . But that does n't mean we reject . '' That last sentiment -- `` that does n't mean we reject . '' -- did it for me . I finally understood why Pope Francis reawakened my faith . I always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins . Like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish . Like not covering my head with a traditional veil at Easter . Like accidentally eating meat on Holy Friday . Like supporting the use of contraception . But as Lacroix told me , Jesus walked with sinners until the very end . He did not banish them to fires of hell , for He refused to give up on anyone . The Cardinal 's last words to me : `` I 'm trying to do my best on -LRB- the -RRB- local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing . To see how we can today respond to those needs . I want people to see me , and the church , as an open heart to grow together . Not a church that 's imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose : the Lord Jesus and his Gospel . '' I ca n't wait to go church next Sunday . And , yes , I will bow my head and pray for forgiveness , and if I 'm worthy , Christ 's love .",his name is cardinal francis.,test,['intrinsic-NP'],[['cardinal francis']]
Goyal’21,cnndm,484b88f32a6422b318e7d5cd25809082579485b9,"Polk City , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- If you drove by it , you would n't even know it 's there . The Ringling Bros. . Center for Elephant Conservation sits on 200 acres of land in rural central Florida , halfway between Orlando and Sarasota , off a nondescript country road . An armed security guard greets you at the entrance . After a short drive down a gravel road , you get the sense this is a special place . `` You can walk around and you do n't hear anything , '' said Kenneth Feld , who opened the center in 1995 . `` These elephants , they have these large feet and they travel silently through the fields . I think it 's very peaceful . '' Twenty-nine elephants currently live here , and 13 more will join the group by 2018 , after Ringling Bros. decided this year to stop using elephants in its traveling circus . `` This was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time , '' said Feld , chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment , the company that owns Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey . The change comes after years of repeated criticism and lawsuits by animal rights groups . The ultimate decision to phase out the elephants , Feld said , is the result of the different laws regulating the use of the animals in each of the 115 cities the circus visits every year . `` You ca n't operate any business , much less with animals , if you do n't have consistency from city to city , '' Feld said . `` It 's a definite expense to be in litigation and to be fighting legislation , and there is a saying and it 's been around for a long time : ` You ca n't fight city hall . ' And we found that to be the case in this situation . '' The circus business has been a part of the Feld family since 1967 , when Irvin Feld purchased Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey . When Irvin died in 1984 , his son , Kenneth , took over . `` This is a whole family affair , '' he said . `` It 's a family affair for our family but also for all the elephants . '' When the center opened 20 years ago , it housed fewer than 10 elephants . `` It was a place for elephants to retire , '' Feld said . Today , the center houses elephants of all ages . `` We have lots of different elephants , meaning males and females , youth elephants , older elephants , so it is a great place to study behavior , '' he said . The center is also focused on breeding the animals . Wendy Kiso , a research and conservation scientist , spends her days at an onsite lab , trying to figure out how to keep the species from going extinct . Part of her lab includes several tanks that `` cryo-preserve '' elephant sperm at negative-196 degrees . `` We process the semen and we extend it in such a way that we can freeze it , '' Kiso said . `` This is a genetic resource bank for Asian elephants . '' Twenty-six elephants have been born here , Feld said . Mike , the newest pachyderm to join the group , was born at the center 's birthing barn nearly two years ago . `` We have the largest and only sustainable herd of Asian elephants in the Western Hemisphere , '' Feld said . Caring for the elephants is no small task . Trudy Williams and her husband , Jim , spend their time taking care of the animals ' daily needs . It takes the couple hours to bathe , walk and feed the elephants every day . `` First thing in the morning , we water them , and give them some treats and feed them some hay , '' Williams said . Each elephant eats about 150 pounds of food a day . Twenty-one tons of hay usually lasts only 10 days at the center . Exercise is also part of the daily routine , including stretching . `` We just do that a few times on each leg with them , just to give them a good stretch , '' Williams said . `` We do some footwork with them . All of our elephants , generally once a month , get a pedicure , just to make sure their feet are in good condition . '' All of this care is n't cheap . `` Each elephant costs over $ 65,000 a year , per year , over all the years of their life , '' Feld said . `` We 're fortunate we 're for profit . We do make a profit and we 're a privately owned family business , and so we 've made a decision we want to devote a lot of resources here . '' It 's a price Feld said he 's willing to pay to keep this species -- some varieties of which in Asia and Africa are endangered -- alive for generations to come . `` I always say , it 's sort of like Jurassic Park with a happy ending , '' Feld said . `` We knew that if we did n't do something , maybe my grandchildren would never have the opportunity to see these incredible animals .

Goyal’21,cnndm,ff4cf78e837bd36ead5799c8051d22a8d7b9b178,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election . Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months , there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement . For Democrats , there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton 's run for the presidency . She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades . She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience , a combination of skills that is often lacking . She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before . She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media , how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies . She is a hardened , tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack . Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name , given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton 's presidency . If Hillary Clinton puts together an effective campaign , she could be unbeatable in the Democratic primaries as well as in the general election . However , during the buildup to her final decision , some of her weaknesses have also been exposed . Clinton does n't want to end up like Vice President Al Gore in 2000 . Although he did relatively well in the final election -LRB- with many Americans believing that he did actually defeat George W. Bush -RRB- he did n't generate much energy once the campaign started . Although he too was touted as a `` perfect '' candidate who was the ideal person for the job , something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail . He seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling . Gore had trouble connecting with voters , and he seemed to remake his image constantly . His biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee , rather than what he actually stood for . Clinton must avoid following Gore 's path . She suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and ca n't afford to do so again . She needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience . That is not enough . More important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the White House . Voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents , even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized Washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change . A recent story in The Washington Post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability . After the announcement , they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire . Clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity . In his first day on the campaign trail , Sen. Rand Paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted . That question has dogged the Clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s . Their greatest virtue , their immense skills as politicians , has often come back to haunt them . Bill Clinton was attacked as `` slick Willie '' by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and Hillary Clinton has faced similar criticism . When she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in Iraq , many Democrats did n't buy her critique of President George W. Bush 's foreign policies and went for Barack Obama instead . When she conducted her `` listening tour '' of New York before running for the Senate , many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider . When she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her State Department email , some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she was n't always telling us what she was really about . Even if she is n't hiding anything , she often gives that appearance . During the next few months , Clinton will also have to connect with her party 's base . The ongoing speculation about Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the Democratic Party is not that enthused with Clinton 's candidacy . While they will probably vote for her , they are not very motivated and do n't trust that she will stand for Democratic values . She will need to address these concerns , not through her style but through her agenda . Voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing . She will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with Iran . Clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large . Without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance , for instance -- that wo n't be aimed at male candidates . Part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism . But the struggle will be tough . Finally , and this relates to the last challenge , Clinton will have to contend with her husband . To be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail , one of the most compelling Democrats of our generation . But he can also be liability . As she learned in 2008 , Bill Clinton is not always easy to control . When he speaks his mind , as he did in dismissive comments about Obama 's candidacy , it can often work against her . The fund-raising records of the Clinton Foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest , and ongoing stories about his personal life , as was the case when Monica Lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago , could re-emerge on the campaign trail . Whether that is fair or not is beside the point : Everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail . Hillary Clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate . But she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months .",she says americans have many positive memories of clinton name.,test,['intrinsic-predicate'],[['she says']]
